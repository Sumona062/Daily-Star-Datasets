"There have been insinuations, remarks and opinions regarding all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan's involvement in Test cricket from the media, cricket experts and even board officials.Looking back, Shakib had missed a few Tests in recent years, lending credibility to arguments about his lack of interest in Tests. Opting out of the New Zealand tour and the consequent drama has put these arguments back in focus. However, there exist finer points between the two arguments that 'Shakib doesn't want to play Tests' and 'Shakib doesn't enjoy Tests'.The second Test against Pakistan in Dhaka, which Bangladesh came very close to grinding out a draw from yesterday, showcased Shakib's enjoyment but also the demotivating factors.Shakib played one of his very special knocks under pressure, but in the end the result did not go in Bangladesh's favour. When that happens, how does Shakib feel?Shakib's ability to not allow anyone to dictate terms was once again on display as he did not let the bowlers feel they were on top of him for a moment. How he dealt with spinners was exemplary. The Pakistan spin duo had a general plan for the Bangladesh batters, getting the ball to pitch right in front of the bat and getting that slight turn to do the trick for them.Shakib was able to adjust remarkably within the same delivery, from a front foot to a slightly back foot stance. He did not need to release shots like Mushfiqur Rahim for instance, but was able to make adjustments late to keep scoring. From a pressure situation, Shakib had a groove about him which took Bangladesh close to a result.A pivotal moment came when Mehedi Hasan Miraz got out to another sweep in the second innings which saw Pakistan come back into the game. As soon as the umpire had signaled not out and Pakistan went for the review, Shakib vehemently chastised Mehedi for playing that shot. Mehedi's two dismissals were significant to the fate of the match.Without arguing in Shakib's favour, when a good player sees the supporting cast fail alongside the team processes, any player has a tendency to be demotivated.Shakib's long-term mentor Nazmul Abedeen Fahim analysed the scenario for The Daily Star.""In the first innings, he counter-attacked to avoid the follow-on due to match scenario. In the second innings, I was relieved to see that he wanted to play good cricket. What he did was very difficult because you need to be in the groove for a long period of time. Unless you love the game and the challenge, you can't do that. One of his best innings,"" Fahim said.""If he was careless, he wouldn't be able to play like that,"" he said.However, once Miraz got out, Shakib changed too, even playing a lofted shot over mid-off that fell short, pointing to his dwindling morale.""Take the case of Mahmudullah Riyad. He was told some 17 months before his Test retirement that he wouldn't be considered [for Tests]. How demotivated must he have felt? But his decision was like shooting yourself in the foot. It became an emotional thing and players are going through such demotivation at the moment,"" Fahim dictated.It cannot be argued that there exists a gap in quality between the generation of the Big Five and the current crop of players.When there are no correct procedures and the existence of haphazard selection process alongside bad results on the pitch, players will find a way to relieve workload or responsibility.That may very well be the phase Shakib's Test career is going through. Not a lack of enjoyment but an existence of demotivation.",sports

"""The pic you've been waiting for,"" read the post from Barcelona's official Twitter account last month, above a photo of the team's new coach Xavi Hernandez talking to a smiling Frenkie de Jong.Xavi was barely into his second week as coach but the hope was that he would already have De Jong nestled under his wing, the advice flowing from one midfielder to another and the clock counting down until the flourishing of another Dutch master in Barcelona colours.For three years now, including two in Spain and his final one at Ajax, the destiny of De Jong has, through no fault of his own, defined almost everything about him as a footballer.His performances have been up and down, and mostly somewhere in between. He has been an obvious pick in Barca's starting line-up but only occasionally a stand-out performer.Against Elche at Camp Nou on Saturday, he was substituted in the second half and whistled by some of his own fans.""Maybe you don't see what he does but he's very good,"" said Xavi.""I don't think I have ever done really badly, but I know I can do better,"" De Jong told AFP in an interview last year.In some ways, the promise of what De Jong can be has been all-consuming.Honed by Ajax and instrumental for the Dutch national team, De Jong owned the two fundamental characteristics to be considered a carrier of 'Barca DNA'.As a child, he even did multiple stadium tours of Camp Nou and wore a shirt with Lionel Messi's name on the back.Perhaps the only way the anticipation could grow further was through a transfer scramble, which was provided when Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City joined the race for De Jong's signature in 2018.It was a fight Barcelona could not afford to lose.Excitement around De Jong had been building ever since he helped engineer Ajax's dismantling of Real Madrid in the Champions League, while Barca's own failures in the tournament meant the craving for young talent had morphed into something closer to desperation.There was political pressure too.The club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu faced anger about repeated capitulations and an increasingly unrecognisable style of play, all on the back of Neymar's humiliating departure to PSG.- Poster boy -The prospect of PSG, a state-funded club, with its perceived lack of identity or history, again beating Barcelona to a player like De Jong, a poster boy for almost everything Barca stood for, was unthinkable.Barcelona paid 75 million euros for De Jong, with a further 11 million euros due in variables, and a club announcement explained in its third paragraph how ""the president Josep Maria Bartomeu and CEO Oscar Grau were personally involved in closing the deal"".""In some ways I've always been a Barcelona player,"" said De Jong, with Camp Nou behind him.Yet in the rush to be seen to buy young, bolster the team's identity, beat PSG and boost the popularity of the president - what was Barcelona's plan for De Jong?How did they expect to improve or even accommodate this talented 21-year-old?In the first game of the season, Barcelona's then-coach Ernesto Valverde offered a show of faith by fielding him ahead of Sergio Busquets. But Barca struggled, Busquets was restored and De Jong shifted to the right of the midfield three.In his two and a half years, De Jong has played right, left, defensive and attacking midfield, as well as right-wing and centre-back. He has played under four permanent coaches, seen Messi leave and Barcelona surrender its status as a serious European club.His best position remains unclear and his future is now in question.Barcelona's financial meltdown means any significant sale is always tempting and De Jong has been linked to both Manchester clubs in recent weeks.He would likely fetch more than 50 million euros in either January or the summer transfer window.For now, the onus is on De Jong to take what could be his last chance under Xavi, to satisfy lofty expectations and make good on a signing that was arguably seen as an end in itself, with too little thought for what came next.",sports
"Bangladesh suffered an embarrassing defeat by an innings and eight runs against Pakistan in the rain-affected second Test of the two-match Test series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur.  Having crumbled to 87 all out in the morning on the fifth day, the hosts were asked to follow on while trailing by 213 runs. And after 83 overs of batting in the second innings, the Tigers were bundled out for 205.   After two 40+ knocks from Liton Das and Mushfiqur rahim in the second innings, Bangladesh at one stage found themselves at 198 for six after 75 overs and were in with a chance of salvaging a draw after Shakib scored a successive team-highest score and more importantly had brought up an impressive fifty partnership with Mehedi Hasan Miraz.But then Pakistan skipper Babar Azam pulled a rabbit out of the hat and decided to bring himself on to bowl the second over of his Test career, in an attempt to break the seventh-wicket stand. The decision immediately paid dividends for the visitors as Miraz was trapped in front trying to play across the line. Miraz's patient 70-ball 14-run knock was spoiled by the sweep shot, which also got the better of him in the first innings.    There was still some light at the end of tunnel for the Tigers with Shakib Al Hasan still at the crease. However, he too departed in the next over, on 63 off 130 balls, having failed to read a sharp turning delivery from Sajid Khan which ended up dismantling the off stump.Sajid went on to scalp the wickets of Khaled Mahmud and Taijul Islam after Taijul and Ebadot Hossain frustrated the visitors with a 34-ball partnership for the last wicket stand.With four wickets in the second innings, Sajid accomplished a stellar 12-wicket haul in his fourth appearance in Tests while Pakistan add maximum ICC World Test Championships points with a 2-0 series win against Bangladesh.",sports
"Premier allrounder Shakib Al Hasan has achieved another career milestone as he became the quickest player to reach the elite club of players with 4000 runs and 200 wickets in Test cricket.After scoring a team-highest of 33 in the first innings of the Dhaka Test yesterday, Shakib was 34 runs short of the landmark on his 59th appearance for the Tigers in the longest format. And with a inside-out drive to Sajid Khan for a boundary in the 56th over of the second innings, the champion performer finds himself among the illustrious company of the likes of Gary Sobers, Ian Botham, Kapil Dev, Jacques Kallis and Daniel Vettori.The left-hander, currently batting to salvage a draw for his side against the odds on the final session of the Test against Pakistan, took 10 Tests fewer than Botham, who acheived the double feat from 69 appearances. Despite being wicketless in the ongoing Test, Shakib boasts 215 wickets in his tally so far, 20 short of Sobers. ",sports
"Mushfiqur Rahim fell two runs short of a half century as Bangladesh keep spiralling deep into trouble on the fifth day of the Dhaka Test.At Tea, Bangladesh are trembling at 147 for 6 after 52.1 overs, with a session left to play on the fifth day of the second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.When Mushfiqur attempted a reverse sweep to Sajid Khan in the 48th over of the second innings, the writing was on the wall for the experienced batter it seemed. And just at the stroke of Tea, Mushfiqur lost the plot completely when he called for a cheeky single and then managed to ran himself out at the striker's end after his 136-ball 48-run knock. The umpire was reluctant to pass the call to third umpire at first but replays showed that Mushfiqur failed to slide the bat onto the ground by the moment wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan dislodged the bails.     Shakib Al Hasan is unbeaten on 25 off 56 deliveries and will be hoping to get all the support from the likes of Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam.  Pakistan, on the other hand, will be looking to wrap up this game and clean sweep the Test series as early as possible, in case bad light stops play prematurely. Shaheen Afridi, Hasan Ali has scalped two wicket for the visitors while Sajid Khan, the star of the first innings with a eight-for, picked the important wicket of Liton Das. ",sports
"Bangladesh surpassed their first innings tally of 87 to reach three figures in the second innings before Liton Das perished as the hosts trail by 104 runs at the first drinks break of the post-lunch session after being enforced a follow-on by Pakistan on the fifth and final day of the Dhaka Test.  The Tigers are in deep water at 109 for five after 38 overs. Shakib Al Hasan, the team-highest scorer of the first innings, has joined Mushfiqur Rahim, on 31 off 97 balls, at the crease.  Liton began the post-lunch session by bringing up the fifty partnership with Mushfiqur for the fifth wicket, as he rocked on the backfoot to pull a Sajid Khan loose, short delivery past the short leg.However, the partnership could only last up to 73 runs as a similar delivery and shot ten overs later brought the downfall of Liton, on 45 off 81 deliveries. This time around, a fielder in Fawad Alam was present at square leg to a take a straightforward catch, much to the delight of Sajid, who added another victim after his eight-wicket haul in the first innings.  Earlier in the session, the wicketkeeper batter got lucky against Shaheen Afridi in the next over when an inside edge from a half-hearted defensive stroke narrowly missed the leg stump.Both Liton and Mushfiqur had played proactively on a wicket which has dried up in the sun and looked in a better shape, comparatively than yesterday, for batters. Still, Pakistan bowlers, especially Afridi, has never looked far from breaking the partnership with his movement, pace and bounce.And more promising signs popped up for the visitors as Sajid got one to bounce awkwardly high for Liton in the middle of the 30th over but Liton got lucky again as the ball landed on the vacant silly point area off his glove.However, it did not require a brilliant delivery nor did the fifth day pitch had any role with the manner Liton got out.     ",sports
"Bangladesh batters Mushfiqur Rahim and Liton Das put on some resistance following the Tigers' top-order collapse after Pakistan had put the hosts to follow-on on the final day of their second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh were able to score 72 for four before umpires signaled for lunch. However, the Tigers, who are following on, still trail by 141 runs. The duo of Mushfiqur and Liton brought some stability in the middle, stitching together an unbeaten 47-run fifth-wicket stand, which is also the highest total so far by Bangladesh in this game.Mushfiqur remained unbeaten on16 off 52 deliveries while Liton, who had started very cautiously as he took 21 balls to open his account, notched up a gear after settling in. Liton pounced on the loose deliveries by Pakistan spinners Nauman Ali and Sajid Khan as the right-hander smashed a total of four boundaries during his unbeaten 46-ball 27. Earlier, Pakistan's pace duo of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Hasan Ali ran riot as they took two wickets each to put Bangladesh in a precarious situation. It was the same old struggle of Bangladesh batters against the pace and swing of the Pakistani pacers that saw the Tigers reeling at 25 for four at one stage of the game. Before that, Pakistan had bundled out Bangladesh for 87, the lowest-ever total in Tests in Mirpur, to enforce a follow-on.   ",sports
"Bangladesh's fragile top-order was once again exposed by the pace threat of Pakistan as the Tigers lost four wickets inside the first 10 overs after being put to follow-on on the final day of their second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. After 11 overs, Bangladesh were left reeling at 27 for four with Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Hasan Ali scalping two wickets each. It was the same old struggle of Bangladesh batters against the pace and swing of the Pakistan pace duo. Debutant Mahmudul Hasan Joy was the first to depart, failing to negotiate a Hasan delivery that nipped in to rattle the right-hander's stumps. Shadman Islam was soon undone by Shaheen as the left-handed batter failed to get his bat down in time and was trapped in front when the pacer had one come back inward after having swung the cherry away for the most occasions. Hasan then had Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque suffer the same fate. But the wicket was only confirmed after a long review as it seemed Mominul's bat was very near to the ball when it hit his pad. The other wicket of Najmul Hossain Shanto was a perfectly executed plan by Pakistan. Having two gullies in place, Shaheen bowled accordingly as his back of a length delivery had squared Shanto up, forcing him to give a catch to one of the fielders at gully. Bangladesh's top-order display has remained abysmal throughout the series. The top four batters accumulated a total of 34 runs in the first innings of this Test, in which the Tigers were bundled out for 87, their lowest total in Mirpur. Also, in the first Test in Chattogram, the same four batsmen were only able to score a total of 67 runs in both the innings of a game that Bangladesh lost by eight wickets.        ",sports
"Bangladesh were put to follow-on as the hosts were bundled out for just 87 runs in the early hours of the final day of their second Test against Pakistan at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Having resumed the day on 76 for seven, Bangladesh required 25 more runs to avoid follow-on. But the Tigers were only able to add 11 on the day, succumbing to their lowest-ever total in Mirpur. The previous lowest total at the venue is 110, also by Bangladesh against Sri Lanka in a Test in 2018.However, Bangladesh's 87-run total is the joint-lowest total in the country. In 2002, West Indies had bundled out Bangladesh for 87 runs at the Bangabandhu National Stadium.   Pakistan off-spinner Sajid Khan, who ran through the Tigers' batting order and scalped six wickets yesterday, gave the visitors their first breakthrough on the day when he had tailender Taijul Islam trapped in front in his very first over. With the sun out for the first time in three days, Pakistan skipper Babar Azam was able to employ pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi from one end as the pacer had started terrorising the Tigers from the word go. The left-arm quick broke through the defenses of Khaled Ahmed, who had no answer to his searing yorker in the day's third over. However, despite losing two wickets very early on the day, the urgency from the Bangladeshi batters continued. Shakib looked to score runs quickly, probably trying to get to the 101-run mark that would see them avoid follow-on. However, his efforts soon came to an end as he gifted his wicket, much like the other Bangladesh batters. He charged down to hit Sajid and only ended up giving an easy catch to the fielder at short-midwicket as Bangladesh's first-innings came to an end in just 32 overs. Sajid, who picked up two wickets today, ended with his career-best figures of eight for 42 in 15 overs that included four maidens.          ",sports
"Bangladesh team director and former national skipper Khaled Mahmud pointed at Bangladesh batters' lack of patience, which led the hosts on the verge of a defeat against Pakistan on the second Test after fourth day's play in Mirpur today.Instead of going for the cautious approach with just over a session to play, after Pakistan declared their first innings on 300 for four at the stroke of Tea, almost all Bangladesh batters were guilty of throwing away their wickets as the Tigers found themselves struggling on 76 for seven, while still needing 25 runs to avoid follow-on, at stumps. ""I have seen the game from upstairs. I don't know why that happened,"" a surprised Mahmud told the media today.  ""There was lack of patience but even though we understand Test batting, still, we were unable to do that. Why this is happening, is something to think about. There was spin in the pitch and their spinners were also bowling well but we do have the ability to play quality spinners. ""Why they couldn't do it or what was the reason to hurry, I don't know. All I Know is that we were supposed to bat the entire day as the Test will finish in the next day [tomorrow] with four or four-and-half sessions left to play. We should learn from Azhar Ali, the way he batted by taking a lot of time at the crease,"" Mahmud added. Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi pacers also came close to the forefront with the likes of Ebadot Hossain and Khaled Ahmed unable to make an impact in the Test series.Asked about when Bangladesh will get good quality fast bowlers, Mahmud replied, ""When Allah wishes, what else I could say! You may train a lot and you could be six feet tall and also have good pace but the coach can't instil everything in you. Coaches can only show you the way and it's you who will have to do it,"" he concluded.",sports
"Bangladesh batter Nazmul Hossain Shanto insisted that not every player played as aggressively as it seemed on the fourth day of their second Test against Pakistan in Mirpur today.Pakistan declared their first innings after scoring 300 for four in 98.3 overs. In reply, Bangladesh's batting collapsed, unable to tackle Pakistan's spin threat as the Tigers were left reeling at 76 for seven before stumps on day four.Bangladesh's batters threw their wickets away as they seemed to be in a rush to collect runs. However, Shanto believed that not all the batters displayed such aggression.""It's not like everyone played aggressively. Each of the batters tried to play the shots they're good at, but probably couldn't execute,"" Shanto said in the press conference after the day's play today.""Execution doesn't happen everyday, it didn't happen today but may happen in the next innings. It's not that we can't execute or have never done it before,"" he added.Even though Bangladesh need 25 runs to avoid follow-on with only three wickets left in hand, the left-handed batter believes the Tigers are still in the game.""I think tomorrow is very important. If Shakib [Al Hasan] bhai and Taijul [Islam] bhai can build a partnership and we can score some more runs then we can have a good chance.""We have the opportunity to bat again tomorrow, and we need to bat really well in order to save the match,"" Shanto said.The visitors had an easier time playing on Mirpur's wicket than the hosts. However, Shanto stated that the wicket was quite challenging to play defensively.""The wicket really wasn't that easy. It's difficult to play defensive shots and spend the entire day.""I don't think this is a wicket to score 300 runs. The spinners and pacers should've conceded fewer runs, the condition was in favour of the seamers. There's no use of thinking about these anymore, we need to ensure not to repeat the same mistakes in the next innings,"" Shanto concluded.",sports
"Woeful batting by Bangladesh on the fourth day of the rain-affected Dhaka Test has brought life back into second Test of the two-match Test series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur.At stumps on Day 4, The hosts find themselves in a precarious yet familiar territory, on 76 for seven after 26 overs in their first innings, and are looking to first pile up a total of 101 to avoid follow-on from here with Taijul Islam set to resume fifth day's action at the crease with Shakib Al Hasan on strike, who has played a 23 off 32-ball knock so far. After Pakistan declared their first innings at 300 for four at the stroke of Tea, Bangladesh top-order had a big advantage as Babar Azam was forced to operate exclusively with spinners due to insufficient light on ground. Shaheen Afridi only got to bowl a solitary over, the first of the innings, and he looked threatening from the word go.  However, it only took Sajid Khan to topple six out of seven batters to have fallen for the hosts, with the other being the dismissal of skipper Mominul, who needlessly tried to sneak a risky single against the run of play and was run-out at the non-striker's end.And the latest to depart was Mehedy Hasan Miraz on naught, who had his off stump dislodged by the right-handed off-spinner, apparently having the game of his life.  All seven batters to have fallen for Bangladesh so far, apart from Najmul Hossain Shanto (30), went out in disappointing fashion, which were against the demand of the game scenario from Bangladesh's perspective.Both Liton Das (6) and debutant Mahmudul Hasan Joy (0) brought their demise by trying to dance down the wicket to combat Sajid, even though the debutant offered a defensive shot unlike Liton, who got caught-and-bowled trying clear mid-on area. And opener Shadman Islam (3) mistimed a forceful cut shot while veteran Mushfiqur Rahim (5) went down attempting to hoick over mid-wicket.The bulk of the bowling was done by Sajid and Nauman Ali, the duo having bowled 24 out of 26 overs for Pakistan. Nauman could have dismissed Shanto earlier on 21 had he not bowled a no-ball. At the end of the day, even skipper Babar chipped in with an over while Sajid boasted an impressive 35 for six in 12 overs. With the latest shambolic display by the Tigers, it is good news however for the Pakistan fans, also the neutrals, as the visitors now have a shot at winning the second Test, which saw only 63.2 overs played in the first three days of play and was destined for a draw, with the rain having had washed out entire third day's action.",sports

"Left-arm seamer Abu Hider bagged his third five-wicket haul in first-class cricket, helping Walton central Zone bundle out Islami Bank East Zone for 245 in their first innings on the first day of the second-round match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.In reply, Central Zone ended the day on four without loss with Mizanur Rahman and Mohammad Mithun set to resume the second day.A lack of patience from the East Zone batters after being asked to bat on a Mirpur sporting pitch was a defining feature of their innings. Despite getting set at the crease, a majority were guilty of throwing away their wickets. Apart from Hider, left-arm spinner Hasan Murad took three wickets and pacer Robiul Hoque scalped up two wickets for Central Zone. Pacer Robiul removed both the openers, with Mohammad Ashraful departing on a duck after he was caught at slip while going for a drive away from his body.Young Shahadat Hossain Dipu then paired with skipper Imrul Kayes and added 51 runs for the second wicket before the latter became Robiul's second victim, handing a straightforward catch to fine leg off a loose delivery.Hider then picked up his first wicket, removing Irfan Shukkur (14), before Murad took a return catch to dismiss Afif Hossain for a duck.Shahadat looked solid and reached his fifty off 99 balls with a gorgeous cover drive to Hider but he too perished as he was trapped leg before by Murad after scoring 72 off 132 balls.After that, Hider ensured his first game of the season would count as he rattled through the East Zone lower-middle order and ended with figures of five for 93. Nayeem Hasan fought a lone battle with the bat in the end for East Zone and was unbeaten on 40.At the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram, veteran Naeem Islam struck his 28th first-class ton as BCB North Zone ended the first day on 246 for four against BCB South Zone.North Zone were initially in a spot of bother after being asked to bat as off-spinner Nahidul Islam removed openers Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Parvez Hossain Emon for ducks. Left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed then trapped Junaid Siddique leg before to leave North Zone struggling on 24 for three before Naeem and skipper Marshall Ayub steadied the ship, adding ninety for the fourth wicket.However, Marshall was dismissed for 47 and Naeem then paired with Mahidul Islam Ankon and added an unbeaten 132-run stand for the fifth wicket. Naeem remained not out on 126 runs off 297 balls, smashing 14 fours and a six, while Ankon was unbeaten on 53.",sports
"The results of the Covid-19 tests that the Bangladesh cricketers underwent in New Zealand yesterday are expected to arrive today and a clean chit would enable to Tigers to get preparations underway for the two-match Test series scheduled to begin from January 1.Bangladesh will be allowed group training for the first time since landing on December 10 if they return negative tests.However, one positive case can complicate matters further and would concern both boards, especially given the tight timeframe.""We are feeling fine after our last Covid-19 test today [Sunday]. If the results come out negative, we will be allowed to practice from the day after tomorrow [Tuesday]. We all are excited about this and looking forward to it,"" left-arm seamer Shoriful Islam said yesterday.The turbulence began after Bangladesh's spin-bowling coach Rangana Herath tested positive for Covid-19 in Christchurch after joining the team from Sri Lanka. It then came to light that New Zealand's first case of the Omicron variant was found on the same flight from Dubai to New Zealand that the Bangladesh team was traveling on, forcing the New Zealand Health Ministry to take strict measures.In line with guidelines from the New Zealand Health Ministry, the visitors were asked to stay at the Managed Isolation Center for three further days of strict room quarantine despite originally being scheduled to move to a team hotel and start outdoor practice from December 17.""We all are doing well. We have been divided into two groups and were given yellow bands. We are able to see each other twice a day while maintaining social distance and it feels good to see each other and talk for a while,"" Shoriful added.",sports
"England captain Joe Root fell in the final over of the fourth day to leave England in deep trouble at 82 for four chasing a massive 468 to win the second Ashes Test, needing a history-making miracle to avoid slumping 2-0 down in the series.Starc floored Root with a painful blow to his abdomen before dismissing the England captain to cap another satisfying day for Australia.""Root is a huge wicket, he is in fantastic form,"" Australia vice-captain Travis Head said. ""I have a lot of sympathy for him. We got told to give him some space (on the pitch).""Starc on that line is never pretty and unfortunately with the day he (Root) has had it wasn't a great time to get hit.""No team has ever posted such a big score in a fourth innings to win in the history of Test cricket -- with the West Indies' 418 for seven in beating Steve Waugh's Australia at St John's in 2003 the highest.For all the pain Root was subjected to after his day was bookended by a couple of brutal blows to what team officials politely described as his ""abdomen"", a more lingering hurt looms with his team staring at a 0-2 Ashes scoreline.Root was dismissed from what proved the last ball of the day four, caught behind off his evening tormentor Mitchell Starc for 24. It capped what would have been a forgettable day for Root and his team if only it had not been etched as deeply in his memory as he burned with pain.Root was absent from the field throughout yesterday's first session after being hit in the unprotected zone by a member of the support staff providing gentle throwdowns before play began, but returned only to cop a far more ferocious hit from Starc shortly before stumps.Travis Head (51 off 54 balls) led the charge for quickfire runs on day four before Jhye Richardson (2-17) shone under lights to edge the home side closer to victory.England's problems stem from being bowled out, after a batting collapse, for 236 on Saturday in reply to Australia's 473 for nine declared.England are still 386 runs adrift, facing the near impossible task of batting out three sessions on the final day to salvage a draw with only six wickets remaining and the world's number one ranked Test batsman back in the pavilion.The hosts resumed their second innings at 45 for one and declared on 230 for nine midway through the second session, giving their bowlers a crack at England with the pink ball as twilight loomed.They immediately made inroads with Jhye Richardson steaming in to Haseeb Hameed and the ball flying off his glove to wicketkeeper Alex Carey without scoring.Dawid Malan, who hit 80 in the first innings, was dropped by Steve Smith, but only lasted three more balls before debutant Michael Neser trapped him lbw for 20.Opener Rory Burns was desperate for a big score after a lean spell and managed 34, but was then beaten by Richardson's sheer pace, edging to Smith at slip.",sports
"Cricket in the United States will break new ground next week when Ireland embark on a landmark five-game tour as moves continue to establish the game in North America.The two Twenty20 and three one-day, 50-over international matches (ODIs) taking place in Lauderhill, Florida starting on Wednesday will be the first time the US national team has faced a Test-playing nation on home soil.That in itself will serve as an important moment for American cricket, which has failed to take root in the United States despite first being played in North America in the 18th century.Yet with firm plans in the works to help establish a T20 professional League within the next two years, which in turn may boost chances of cricket making its Olympic debut in Los Angeles at the 2028 Games, the timing of Ireland's visit couldn't be better.Furthermore, this is the first home series since confirmation that the US will co-host the 2024 T20 World Cup with the West Indies.USA are currently ranked 18th in the world for ODIs, according to the International Cricket Council, the sport's governing body, and although Ireland are currently 12th -- for T20 the rankings are 30 and 13 respectively -- there is a strong belief that the Americans can upset the form book.""This is the biggest home series we have had,"" USA captain Monank Patel told AFP. ""This means a lot to the team and this acts as the start for the global qualifiers for the big tournaments coming up,"" the Gujarat-born wicketkeeper added.US optimism is also based on the emergence of a promising crop of youth players, which includes highly-rated wicketkeeper Rahul Jariwala, 17, and 19-year-old left-arm spinner Vatsal Vaghela, who have both earned call-ups for the first time.Both come from Northern California and impressed recently in a 50-over National Championships.Led by San Francisco 49ers executive CEO Paraag Marathe, USA Cricket has reformed and refocused, not only looking to establish strong community links but also pushing the national team further into the conversation.USA Cricket claims there are over 200,000 playing at the grassroots, mostly of South Asian heritage.National success would help raise interest levels in the sport and although qualification for the most recent Twenty20 World Cup ended in failure, with another opportunity up for grabs in 2022, joining the party in Australia is a realistic ambition.",sports

"Bangladesh's dreams of reaching the semifinal of the ICC T20 World Cup were virtually dashed following their heart-breaking three-run defeat to West Indies on Friday, which was their third consecutive defeat in the mega-event.Yesterday was unlike the other days at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Dubai, where the Bangladesh team is staying, in that there was no rush from the players at the breakfast table. The team management had announced two days of rest for the demoralised Tigers, allowing them to resume training from November 1 ahead of their fourth Super 12 game against South Africa in Abu Dhabi the following day.The cricketers opted to stay in their hotel rooms throughout the day, not that they had much choise given the Covid-19 protocols which even forbid them from stepping down to the lobby from their designated floors. The members of the Bangladesh team have often shared experiences about life inside the bio-secure bubble, but the situation after the defeat to West Indies was gloomy.""Mentally, it's very disturbing to be honest. We are not in a state of mind to share what we are going through following one defeat after another. It hurts more when you lose close matches like we did against Sri Lanka and West Indies because it shatters self-confidence,"" a member of the team said, requesting anonymity.Despite the fact that Bangladesh have two games remaining -- against South Africa and Australia -- in the Super 12, there is still a lot to gain for the Tigers in terms of confidence and finishing the World Cup journey on a positive note.""All the players are very upset after yesterday's (Friday's) game. Apart from the game against England, when we were totally outplayed, there was a chance for us to win the other games against Sri Lanka and West Indies. Obviously, the game against Sri Lanka was a heartbreaker for us. If we could win that game, it would have boosted our confidence for the next two games. But we still have two more World Cup matches, which are very vital considering the tournament,"" selector Habibul Bashar told the media yesterday.""Yes, we can say we have virtually no chance for the semifinal, but we want to finish our World Cup mission with wins which can be very important for us.

" The Daily Star (DS): Welcome to Bangladesh. How do you feel after coming to your second home after such a long period?Margarita Mamun (MM): It is my first visit after the Rio Olympic Games and I'm really happy and amazed to have received such a warm welcome from Bangladeshi people. I'm really happy to be here with my family. My mother is here, after 15 years, as well as my husband and our two-year-old son, who are here for the first time.DS: You were 10 when you came to visit your grandfather's home in Rajshahi? Can you recall memories from that trip which took place 15 years ago?MM: I can remember in flashbacks but I have a lot of pictures and videos from that trip. I think I will visit the beautiful Rajshahi next time when I come back with more time in hand. Of course, this will not be our last visit here.DS: Take us to the beginning of your gymnastics career.  What made you choose the sport?MM: After seeing rhythmic gymnastics on television, I just liked it so much that my mother had to take me out to play the sport.DS: We know your mother was also a rhythmic gymnast, who perhaps inspired you but what about the role of your father -- Abdullah Al Mamun -- in your career?MM: My mother was an aspiring gymnast. Unfortunately, she only had a couple of months of training because her parents couldn't take her to the training every day. My father was always supportive and was proud of me, starting from when I achieved medals at the age-level to the ones at European Championships and World Cup.DS: How challenging was your experience as a rhythmic gymnast in Russia?MM: I practiced every day, almost 24 hours (big laugh) I think. In Russia, as there are too many talented girls, it was extremely hard to pursue a place in the national team. There was a time when I almost competed for Bangladesh, even though there was no rhythmic gymnastics in Bangladesh at that time. My father knew Mamun [Bashir Ahmed], who was the president of the Bangladesh Gymnastic Federation at that time but then my head coach Irina Viner intervened and gave me the opportunity to feature for the Russian national team.DS: But you once represented Bangladesh during your childhood.MM: Yes, it was an international competition held in Germany but not recognised by FIG [International Gymnastics Federation]. I think Bangladeshi people are happy to know that I once competed for Bangladesh. My father had also brought the Bangladeshi press when I became world champion in 2013 and he showed me how to celebrate with the people. DS: You have been known as the Bengal Tiger. Can you tell the story behind it?MM:  After the London Olympics 2020, I became the Russian national team's number one and had the spotlight from the press. Coach Irina knew my background. She told the journalists that they can call me Bengal Tiger as I'm half Bengali and the journalists picked it up from there.DS: Why did you call time after winning gold at Rio at the age of 20, whereas most athletes usually take part in the Olympics for more than one occasion?MM: Among many reasons, I had some injury concerns and health-related issues, so I decided before the Rio Olympics that it would be my first and last Olympics. I had already been a world champion at the age of 17 by then.DS: What keeps you occupied these days?MM: I am now a full-time mom who prioritises the family because I didn't often see my family when I was in training. But now, I think that after this trip when I go back home, I will discuss with Mr. Mamun [Bashir Ahmed] how I can help my second home.DS: What advice do you have for Bangladeshi athletes who are trying to improve their standard to compete at the world-class level?MM: I know Bangladesh is still waiting to win an Olympic medal. The big question is: How Bangladeshi athletes can achieve the highest results? I think I can assist, maybe not as a coach but maybe as a United Nations ambassador where I can inspire aspiring athletes to become bold dreamers. I think the impact has to be in all walks of life, not just on the sporting or the professional front.DS: Finally, do you know the Bengali language, and if so, would you like to say something in Bengali to the readers of The Daily Star?MM: Of course! When I was young, my father taught me the numbers: Ek, dui, tin, char, paach, chhoy, shat, aat, noy and dosh. I know some Bengali words like Shundor [beautiful] and one phrase, which is: Aami Bangladesh ke bhalobashi [I love Bangladesh].",sports

"Manchester City's Joao Cancelo scored one goal and made another as they overwhelmed struggling Newcastle United 4-0 on Sunday to ensure they will spend Christmas Day top of the Premier League.The visitors were gifted the opening goal in the fifth minute when Cancelo acrobatically crossed for Ruben Dias to head into an empty net after a mix-up between Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and defender Ciaran Clarke.Cancelo added a second in the 27th minute, cutting in from the right wing and capping off a solo run with a stunning strike to silence the home crowd.Newcastle were denied what looked to be a clear penalty on the half-hour mark when City keeper Ederson clattered into Ryan Fraser, but neither referee Martin Atkinson nor the VAR decided to intervene.Despite starting the second half with a pair of fine saves from Dubravka, things got worse for Newcastle as Mahrez turned home Kevin De Bruyne's cross from the left wing with a deft volley in the 63rd minute to notch his 50th Premier League goal.Newcastle had introduced Allan Saint-Maximin off the bench at halftime for Joe Willock but they only managed one effort on target over the 90 minutes - a close-range header from Callum Wilson that forced a superb one-handed save from Ederson.Sterling's industrious performance on the wing was rewarded in the 86th as Gabriel Jesus drove the ball across the goal and the England forward slammed it home to complete the rout.The dominant performance keeps City top on 44 points, four ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who visit Tottenham Hotspur later on Sunday, and six clear of Chelsea in third after they were held to a 0-0 draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers.Newcastle stay second-bottom on 10 points.

"Hosts Bangladesh completed their first-ever Asian Champions Trophy campaign in fifth position among five teams following a 6-2 defeat to former world champions Pakistan in the last pool match at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.Pakistan, who needed a point to qualify for the last four, finished third and the margin of victory helped them avoid defending champions India in the semifinals. Pakistan grabbed third position by virtue of superior goal difference over Japan, who in the day's first match suffered a 6-0 defeat to table-toppers India.Pakistan will take on second-placed South Korea while India will square off against Japan in the semifinals, billed for Tuesday at the same venue.Bangladesh, who conceded 23 goals and scored four goals in four matches, finished without a single point.Despite knowing that a win would take them to the semifinals, the men in red and green took to the field with a defensive strategy and kept their opponents at bay initially.The charges of Iman Gobinathan Krishnamurthy raised their hopes of even an upset victory after taking the lead against the run of play when Arshad Hossain scooped home in the 13th minute after Rashel Mahmud Jimmy stopped a fierce hit from Shohanur Rahman.But the lead lasted only for a minute as Pakistan hit back strongly with a close-range strike from Nadeem Ahmed. Since that point nothing went in favour of Bangladesh, who could not match Pakistan's pace and pressing hockey. Instead, Bangladesh's defence was exposed badly in face of crisp passing from Pakistan in the attacking third.With Bangladesh struggling to negotiate with the opposition players, Pakistan took the lead three minutes into the second quarter when Ahmed Ajaz darted into the circle from the right almost without any challenge before beating goalkeeper Biplob Khujur with a diagonal hit while Arfaz and captain Umar Bhutta netted one goal apiece in the 24th and 26th minutes to shatter Bangladesh's confidence before going to the break with a comfortable 4-1 lead.After resumption, Bangladesh came out of the sit-back strategy to launch attacks down the two flanks but were well resisted by Pakistan, who widened the margin through a penalty-corner strike from Muhammad Razzak in the 34th minute. One minute later, Bangladesh pulled one goal back with Arshad Hossain tapping in a diagonal hit from Ashraful Islam but Ajaz restored the margin again with a tap-in in the 38th minute.  The home team then collectively defended the area to keep the defeat to a reasonable margin. ",sports

"Following their valiant display in a 3-2 defeat against South Korea on Friday, the Bangladesh national hockey team reverted to type, suffering a 5-0 defeat against Japan in their third match of the Hero Asian Champions Trophy at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.The charges of Iman Gobinathan Krishnamurthy, who started the campaign with a 9-0 defeat against India, kept Japan at bay in the first quarter before breaking down against the wave of Japanese attacks.The men in red and green conceded two field goals, two goals from penalty corners and one from a penalty stroke. ""Since we played a hard match yesterday, it might have caused fatigue on our players,"" Bangladesh captain Ashraful Islam said after the match.The host nation, who lie bottom of the five-team table with zero points from three matches, still have a chance to make it to the semifinals if they manage to beat Pakistan in their last round robin match today.Pakistan, who were held to a 3-3 draw by South Korea yesterday, have two points from three matches.""Since both we and Pakistan are out of international hockey for a long time, I think we have a chance against Pakistan tomorrow. If we can play well and take our chances, we can come out with a positive result,"" Ashraful said. ""We will watch video footages of Pakistan's matches tonight and we will try to find out their weaknesses to take advantage of those in the match,"" the Bangladesh captain added.The match between Pakistan and South Korea proved to be a topsy-turvy affair.Pakistan fought back from a goal down in the first quarter to take a 2-1 lead early in the third quarter but Korea bounced back and scored two in the final quarter to take a lead. However, Pakistan scored again with three minutes remaining to salvage a point from this fixture that left them in fourth position on the table. South Korea were in second position with six points from four matches. Japan occupied the third position with five points from three matches.",sports

"A resolute Bangladesh surrendered an early lead to suffer a narrow 3-2 defeat to South Korea in their second match of the Hero Asian Champions Trophy at Maulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium yesterday.It was the second defeat in as many matches in the hockey tournament for the men in red and green, who have not featured in international matches since the 2018 Asian Games. And despite being on the face of adversity, the hosts fought bravely against a strong Korean side, who came into the match following a 3-3 draw against Japan and a 2-2 draw India.After a humiliating 9-0 thrashing at the hands of India in the first match, everyone expected a damage-control performance against South Korea, who had struck 23 goals in the last three meetings between two sides. However, the charges of Iman Gobinathan Krishnamurthy showed great strength in character to raise the hope of snatching a point but silly mistakes had cost them dearly.Arshad Hossain gave Bangladesh an unexpected lead in the eighth minute, tapping in a fierce hit from Fazle Rabbi, before Korea levelled the margin in the 15th minute through a penalty stroke.In the second and third quarters, Bangladesh hardly gave Korea space to unsettle the backline with debutant goalkeeper Biplob Khujur making a couple of good saves. Then the resistance finally broke down in the 47th minute with Ji Woo Cheon scoring a goal in the same manner like Arshad did earlier.An unmarked Park Cheoleon made it 3-1 in the 54th minute with a fierce hit inside the circle before Deen Mohammad Emon reduced the margin two minutes from time but could not find the equaliser from then on.""We have been viewed negatively after last match's performance, so we were determined to stick to the game plan for a better performance. The coach helped us mentally and showed how to play against Korea but we had to lose the match due to some silly mistakes,"" said goalkeeper Biplob, who was adjudged man-of-the-match.  ""It was my first international match for the senior team, so I tried to give something to the nation. The feeling is really good to be named the man of the match in the first international match"" said the Abahani goalkeeper.In the day's first match, hot-favourites India handed an emphatic 3-1 defeat to Pakistan at the same venue and kept their recent dominance intact over archrivals.Defending champions India have not only consolidated their top position in the five-team table but also kept their unbeaten run against rivals Pakistan to 12 matches in a row, which includes only a draw, while Pakistan with one point from two matches, remained winless against their perennial rivals India for last five years since their 1-0 triumph in gold-deciding match of South Asian Games in 2016.Even though the tie between India and Pakistan was deemed to be a mouth-watering battle, the high-voltage tie could hardly enthral a few hundred spectators who rather watched the erratic passing and poor finishing upfront from both sides but India had the last laugh, thanks to penalty corner conversions.From the onset, India had been fast to take control of the match through their all-out attack alongside an early lead while Pakistan banked on the counter but their individual efforts and erratic passing kept them at bay.India took a 2-0 lead within 42 minutes with strikes from Harmanpreet Singh and Akashdeep Singh before Junaid Manzoor reduced the margin in the 45th minute. Harmanpreet wrapped up the victory converting another penalty in the 53rd minute.",sports

"In what is anticipated to be a thrilling contest between the archrivals, two Asian heavyweights India and Pakistan will square off against each other in a crucial fixture of the Asian Champions Trophy men's hockey tournament at the Maulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium today.India lead the five-team table with four points from two matches while Pakistan are second from the bottom with one point from as many matches. The encounter between seven-time Olympic gold-medallist India and four-time World Cup winner Pakistan once promised a fierce battle but somehow it has turned into one-way traffic with India beating Pakistan convincingly on a few occasions in the recent past. The contest, however, still stands out due to the age-old rivalry between the two neighbouring countries.Pakistan could not beat India in the Champions Trophy since their thrilling 5-4 win in 2013. In fact, Pakistan suffered defeats – 3-2, 3-2 and 3-1 –  in their last three meetings in this tournament between 2016 to 2018.Pakistan were also handed two defeats by India in Dhaka during the Asia Cup in 2017 with India notching up an emphatic 3-1 win in the group stage before registering a thumping 4-0 victory in the Super Fours.Despite the recent success of India, Pakistan still have an edge in overall wins between the two sides.""We can't disrespect any team because every team came here to give their best.

"The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation is looking to turn 214 acres of Madhupur Sal Forest into an industrial park.The corporation wants to set up a fruit processing plant at Beribaid Mouja, marked by the Forest Department as part of a reserved Sal forest.The plan is to build a road, drainage system, dump yard, an effluent treatment plant, and utility lines in the forest, which according to the Mymensingh Agricultural University is home to numerous shrubs, medicinal plants, flower plants, monkeys, deer, and different species of birds.Implementing the project may cost an estimated Tk 400 crore, said immediate past chairman of the corporation Mostaque Hassan.The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) sent a letter to the Department of Environment (DoE) in Tangail on June 9, seeking to get the land on lease.Since 1925, the Sal forest has lost 80,000 acres, which is two thirds of its land due to deforestation and encroachment, according to Forest Department data.Pavel Partha, coordinator of Bangladesh Resource Centre For Indigenous Knowledge, said the Sal forest in Madhupur is dominated by trees that lose their foliage at the end of the growing season. It is the last of it's kind in Bangladesh, he said, adding that an industrial park will put its biodiversity at risk.Deforesting another 214 acres by leasing it out will violate the Forest Act-1927, National Land Use Policy, National Forest Policy and a Cabinet Division circular from 2015.Besides, Bangladesh promised to end deforestation by 2030 at the recently concluded 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland.Jahirul Haque, divisional forest officer in Tangail, said he was not aware of the BSCIC plan. ""All I can say is that it [industrial park] will not be allowed by the law. People are not even allowed to enter a reserved forest without authorisation.""Contacted, Mohammad Mojahidul Islam, deputy director at the DoE, said, ""We will make a decision after the forest department states its opinion.""In September last year, the then BSCIC chairman Mostaque Hassan visited the project site. The chairman said a detailed project plan was being made.""There are some land of the forest. If necessary, we will exempt the forestland and implement the project,"" he told The Daily Star.The land has been lying idle, he said, adding that an industrial park would create ""employment opportunities for young people"".""I talked to the agriculture minister. He promised to help us get the lease,"" he said.BSCIC operates under the Ministry of Industries and the matter in question is not directly related to the Ministry of Agriculture.Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA), said the High Court in 2018 and 2019 asked the authorities concerned to demarcate the Madhupur Sal Forest and ensure that the communities native to the region can maintain their traditional ways of living. The court also ordered protecting the biodiversity of the forest.""How could the BSCIC plan to set up an Industrial Park inside the Sal forest when the High Court clearly ordered not to use the forestland for any commercial purposes?"" she asked.WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY?In 2018, the HC ordered officials of the forest and administration to frame rules under Forest Act-1927 to ensure regeneration of Madhupur Sal Forest through plantation of indigenous species with the participation of forest-dependent people.Section-17 of the National Land Use Policy-2001 insists that such forestland should be conserved, maintained, and expanded.State Acquisition and Tenancy Act-1950 prevents forest from being leased out and declared forest land as non-retainable property.Besides, the forest department's letter of no-objection is required for the construction of any structure on land belonging to the Forest Department, said a Cabinet Division circular in 2015.In 2018, a land ministry circular requested the deputy commissioners of the district not to lease out any protected and reserved forest.",environment

"The governor of an island province in the central Philippines said Sunday at least 63 people died in the devastation wrought by Typhoon Rai in more than half of the towns that managed to contact him, bringing the death toll in the strongest typhoon to batter the country this year to at least 112.Gov. Arthur Yap of Bohol province said 10 others were missing and 13 injured, and suggested the fatalities may still considerably increase with only 33 out of 48 mayors able to report back to him due to downed communications. Officials were trying to confirm a sizable number of deaths caused by landslides and extensive flooding elsewhere.In statements posted on Facebook, Yap ordered mayors in his province of more than 1.2 million people to invoke their emergency powers to secure food packs for large numbers of people along with drinking water, which he said was an urgent problem since water stations were down during power outage.After joining a military aerial survey of typhoon-ravaged towns, Yap said ""it is very clear that the damage sustained by Bohol is great and all-encompassing.""He said the initial inspection did not cover four towns, where the typhoon blew in as it rampaged on Thursday and Friday through central island provinces. The government said about 780,000 people were affected, including more than 300,000 residents who had to evacuate their homes.At least 39 other typhoon deaths were reported by the disaster-response agency and the national police. Officials on Dinagat Islands, one of the southeastern provinces first pounded by the typhoon, separately reported 10 deaths just from a few towns, bringing the overall fatalities so far to 112.President Rodrigo Duterte flew to the region Saturday and promised 2 billion pesos ($40 million) in new aid. Aides said the president will visit Bohol on Sunday.At its strongest, the typhoon packed sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 270 kph (168 mph), one of the most powerful in recent years to hit the disaster-prone archipelago, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.Floodwaters rose rapidly in Bohol's riverside town of Loboc, where residents were trapped on their roofs and trees. They were rescued by the coast guard the following day. On Dinagat Islands, an official said the roofs of nearly all the houses, including emergency shelters, were either damaged or blown away.At least 227 cities and towns lost electricity, which has since been restored in only 21 areas, officials said, adding three regional airports were damaged, including two that remain closed.The deaths and widespread damage left by the typhoon ahead of Christmas in the largely Roman Catholic nation brought back memories of the catastrophe inflicted by another typhoon, Haiyan, one of the most powerful on record. It hit many of the central provinces that were pummeled last week, leaving more than 6,300 people dead in November 2013.About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year.

"A powerful typhoon left at least 19 people dead, knocked down power and communications in entire provinces and wrought widespread destruction mostly in the central Philippines, officials said Saturday. A governor said her island province has been ""leveled to the ground.""Typhoon Rai blew away Friday night into the South China Sea after rampaging through southern and central island provinces, where more than 300,000 people in its path were evacuated to safety in advance in a pre-emptive move officials say may have saved a lot of lives.At its strongest, Rai packed sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 270 kph (168 mph), one of the most powerful in recent years to hit the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. The typhoon slammed into the country's southeastern coast Thursday but the extent of casualties and destruction remained unclear two days after with entire provinces still without power and cellphone connection.The national police reported at least 19 dead but did not provide other details. The government's main disaster-response agency reported a lower death toll of 12, mostly villagers hit by falling trees, because it said it had to carefully validate each death.Officials on Dinagat Islands, one of the first provinces to be lashed by the typhoon's ferocious winds, remained cut off Saturday due to downed power and communication lines. But its governor, Arlene Bag-ao, managed to post a statement on the province's website to say that the province of about 180,000 ""has been leveled to the ground."" She pleaded for food, water, temporary shelters, fuel, hygiene kits and medical supplies. She said only a few casualties have been reported in the capital so far because other towns remain isolated.""We may have survived, but we cannot do the same in the coming days because of our limited capacities as an island province,"" Bag-ao said, adding some of Dinagat's hospitals could not open due to damage. ""Most of our commercial and cargo vessels ... are now unsuitable for sea voyages, effectively cutting us off from the rest of the country.""Vice Gov. Nilo Demerey managed to reach a nearby province and told DZMM radio network that at least six residents died and that ""almost 95% of houses in Dinagat have no roof,"" and even emergency shelters were destroyed.""We're currently doing repairs because even our evacuation centers were destroyed. There are no shelters, the churches, gymnasium, schools, public markets and even the capitol were all shattered,"" Demerey said.Pictures posted on Dinagat's website show low-slung houses with roofs either blown off or damaged and surrounded by tin roof sheets and debris.In central Bohol province, which was directly hit by the typhoon, the coast guard said its personnel on board rubber boats rescued residents who were trapped on roofs and trees, as waters rose rapidly. It released footage showing coast guard staff helping people from the roof of a house nearly engulfed by brownish floodwater to a rubber boat. They also help a villager climb down from a tree above the floodwater while another man, also wearing an orange life vest, waits for his turn.With government contingency funds used for the coronavirus pandemic, President Rodrigo Duterte said he would look for money to help the provinces.

"On a November afternoon several weeks back, a middle-aged man, appearing to be a fish vendor, was spotted in Kaminiganj Bazar area of Moulvibazar's Juri upazila.But after peeking through the net covering of the bamboo basket he was carrying, over a dozen of live migratory birds were found inside, said Saddam Mia, a resident of the area, which is in close proximity to Hakaluki Haor -- one of the country's largest marsh wetlands and an Ecologically Critical Area.Hakaluki Haor is spread out across Juri, Kulaura and Barlekha upazilas of Moulvibazar, and Golapganj and Fenchuganj upazilas of Sylhet.Poaching and illegal trade of migratory birds have been on the rise in areas that surround large waterbodies such as Hakaluki Haor, as both poachers and sellers are increasingly adopting innovative and deceptive techniques to catch and sell the birds.This correspondent came across one such illegal bird seller recently in Kaminiganj Bazar, near the BGB camp. In his basket, there were 12 brownish migratory birds with long and sharp beaks, resembling common snipes. Asked, he said he bought them from hunters who caught the birds by setting traps near the haor. He said he had already sold 13 that day. The seller left the spot hastily when this correspondent started taking snaps of the birds.Several poachers as well as locals, requesting anonymity, said migratory birds are quite popular among villagers, and each bird sells between Tk 300 and 500, depending on size.Bird trader Sadek Mia said a huge number of birds visiting the haors are ensnared every day and sold to locals in surrounding areas.To attract the birds, the poachers tie down a live wild bird beside a trap in a bush in the haor area and place a digital device that continuously plays previously recorded audio of migratory birds chirping while they wait after nightfall.By midnight, a good number of the birds are trapped and later taken away by the poachers, Sadek explained.     Abdul Karim Kim, general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon's Sylhet chapter, said various species of migratory birds or wild birds from different parts of the world start arriving at the haor around winter.The number of birds in and around Hakaluki Haor has been waning in recent times, as an increased number of poachers have been using pesticide-soaked paddy to poison the birds, while many others have been catching them with traps, he added.A joint bird census -- conducted on February 24 and 25 in 43 beels of the haor -- by International Union for Conservation of Nature and Bangladesh Bird Club counted 24,551 birds belonging to 48 species.In 2020, the bird count was nearly double -- 40,126 birds belonging to 53 species.The nature and biodiversity in the haor area are under serious threat, as hunting and selling of migratory birds have been going on unabated there, primarily due to people's ignorance and greed, acknowledged Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, divisional forest officer of Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation Division in Sylhet.Illegal wildlife trade amounts to about Tk 10 crore annually in Bangladesh, forcing many of the country's wild animals and birds to go extinct, he also said.

"Smoke from cooking stoves that burn coal, wood, dung, and crop residues caused the deaths of almost 18,000 people in Bangladesh in 2017, according to a global study. The World Health Organisation says combustion from stoves contributes to heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and respiratory infections.In 2017, 63,718 deaths were due to ambient (outdoor) PM2.5 in Bangladesh, where residential fuel use is the single largest source for PM2.5, said the study.It said residential fuel contributed to 28.2 percent of the ambient air pollution, followed by energy with 12.4 percent.In Bangladesh, such stoves have long posed a serious danger to women, who usually shoulder the burden of cooking, according to the Health Effects Institute (HEI) study styled ""Global Burden of Disease-Major Air Pollution Sources."" The study report is scheduled to be released today.Earlier, the HEI's State of Global Air survey said particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is the sixth highest risk factor for deaths globally, accounting for nearly four million deaths in 2019.The burning of solid biofuels, such as wood for indoor heating and cooking, is a major source of PM 2.5, accounting for an additional 740,000 deaths, especially across South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the study said.The study also finds that 770,000 deaths could have been prevented if people stop using solid fossil fuels like coal.It said fossil fuel combustion, a major source of air pollution, contributed to more than one million deaths globally in 2017, more than 27 percent of all deaths from outdoor PM 2.5.The report also said coal combustion alone was responsible for half of those deaths, with natural gas and oil combustion accounting for the other half.The study team, led by Erin McDuffie and Randall Martin of Washington University in St Louis, USA, and Michael Brauer at the University of British Columbia in Canada, provide the first-ever comprehensive global analysis estimating major sources of air pollution for every country in the world.The new report noted that major sources of PM 2.5 can vary by country and region, and different parts of the world were impacted by air pollution in different ways.While fossil fuel combustion made up most of the PM 2.5 across the industrialised nations of the global north, windblown dust was a major source of PM 2.5 in African countries.Dr Pallavi Pant, senior scientist of HEI, said, ""To improve air quality across South Asia, it is important to consider the major sectors that are contributing to PM2.5 including energy production, residential cooking and heating, industries, transportation, waste etc., and design targeted measures to reduce emissions at source.""Abdus Salam, an air quality expert and a professor of the Department of Chemistry at Dhaka University, said cooking is one of the key concerns of indoor air pollution especially in rural areas as biomass is used widely.""But coal is not largely used in cooking in Bangladesh,"" he said, adding that cooking behaviour should be changed to improve the situation.He also said dust was another important PM 2.5 contributor that originated from construction activities, streets, as well as windblown particles.The HEI is an independent, non-profit research institute funded jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, industry, foundations, and development banks to provide credible, high-quality science on air pollution and health for air quality decisions.",environment

"Delhi shut down schools until further notice, urged people to work from home and banned non-essential trucks from entering the Indian capital due to dangerous levels of air pollution.One of the world's most polluted cities and home to some 20 million people, Delhi is cloaked every winter in a thick blanket of smog.On Saturday, the Delhi government had ordered schools to close for a week and banned construction work for four days.But in an order passed late Tuesday, the Commission for Air Quality Management for Delhi said all education institutions should remain shut until further notice.Lorries except those carrying essential goods are barred from entering the capital until November 21 and most construction activity was halted, the order said.""Anti-smog guns"" and water sprinklers were ordered to operate at hotspots at least three times a day.Six of the 11 thermal power plants within a 300-kilometre radius were told to cease operations until further notice.The commission also said that at least 50 percent of staff employed in government should work from home and encouraged those in private firms to follow suit.The order comes days after the Delhi government pushed back against a call by India's Supreme Court to declare a ""pollution lockdown"" -- a first -- which would restrict the city's population to their homes.One of the contributors to the air pollution in winter is the smoke from farmers burning their crop residue in neighbouring states.The government, however, told the Supreme Court that industry was the biggest contributor followed by vehicular pollution and dust.This week, PM 2.5 levels -- the most harmful particulate matter that is responsible for chronic lung and heart disease -- have been over 400 in several parts of the city.Last week, the levels touched 500 which is more than 30 times the maximum limit recommended by the World Health Organization.A Lancet report in 2020 said almost 17,500 people died in Delhi in 2019 because of air pollution.And a report by Swiss organisation IQAir last year found that 22 of the world's 30 most polluted cities were in India.

"The morning after Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, residents of New Delhi woke up under a blanket of toxic smog and breathed in the most dangerously polluted air of the year so far, after revellers, as usual, defied a fireworks ban.New Delhi has the worst air quality of all world capitals, but even by its sorry standards Friday's reading was extra bad, as people paid the price for celebrating India's biggest festival in the noisiest, and most smoky way.The Air Quality Index (AQI) surged to 451 on a scale of 500 - the maximum recorded this year - indicating ""severe"" conditions that affect healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases, according to the federal pollution control board's guidance.The AQI measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter PM2.5 in a cubic metre of air. In Delhi, a city of nearly 20 million people, the PM2.5 reading on Friday averaged 706 micrograms, whereas the World Health Organization deems anything above an annual average of 5 micrograms as unsafe.Airborne PM2.5 can cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. And, in India, toxic air kills more than a million people annually.""The firecracker ban didn't seem to be successful in Delhi, which led to hazardous pollution levels adding on top of existing perennial sources,"" Sunil Dahiya, Analyst, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said.Every year, either government authorities or India's Supreme Court impose a ban on firecrackers. But the bans rarely appear to be enforced.Making matters worse, Diwali falls in period when farmers in the Delhi's neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana burn the stubble left after harvesting to prepare their fields for the next crop.Stubble fires accounted for up to 35% of New Delhi's PM2.5 levels, according to data from SAFAR's monitoring system, which falls under the federal Ministry of Earth SciencesA rare spell of clear skies in October due to intermittent rains and winds had helped Delhiites breathe their cleanest air in at least four years.But during winter months pollution levels surge in northern India, as lower temperatures and a drop in wind speed tend to trap pollutants in the air longer.Sick of the lack of commitment to making the capital more livable, Ambrish Mithal, a doctor at the Max HealthCare hospital in New Delhi, vented his frustration over the deteriorating AQI readings.""It's terrible for those with allergies and asthma. We will continue to squabble over reasons and are doomed to suffer,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter.Indian governments are often accused of not doing enough to curb pollution, as they prioritise economic growth to lift living standards in the world's second-most populated country.On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow that India would achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070, but some experts reckoned that target was at least two decades too late.",environment

The air remains mostly acceptable from June to October.According to experts, authorities need to chalk out a special action plan to control Dhaka's terrible dust pollution, as it turns worse every winter, particularly from November to February, posing a serious health hazard to city dwellers.During winter, the city's air quality starts deteriorating sharply due to massive discharge of pollutant particles from construction sites, rundown roads, brick kilns and other sources, they say.Ainun Nishat, professor emeritus at Brac University, said dust particles from construction sites, earth filling, black smoke from overloaded motor vehicles and traditional brick kilns located on the outskirts of Dhaka are largely responsible for making the city's air quality worse in winter.""So, all traditional brick kilns should be modernised as soon as possible,"" he said.",environment
"Eminent actress Afsana Mimi was a popular face of television drama, in the 90s. Her acting in numerous dramas received a lot of appreciation and love, so did her works as television director. After a long time, she is all set to make a comeback with her film this year. In a recent chat with The Daily Star, she talked about her upcoming project.We wish you a very happy birthday. How are you spending this special day?I prefer spending my birthdays all by myself. I really like it when my birthday comes since I get to see the amount of love people have for me. This is the thing that makes me happy. Currently, I am very far from Dhaka city. I am in my maternal grandparent's house which is located at Bagerhat, I have come here after a very long time. After about 10 years, I got so close to all my relatives. Considering how busy everyone's lives has become these days, we rarely get the chance to gather together. It is an amazing feeling, and I am having a good time. To be honest, when I came to Syed Mahalla, I became a little nostalgic. This place has so many bittersweet memories.It has been a long time since audience last saw you in any film.I am working in the film titled ""Paap Punno"", directed by Giasuddin Selim. I do not think I need to say anything about how amazing his work is. His film, ""Monpura"", did tremendously well. ""Paap Punno"" has a different storyline, and we did the shoot in Chandpur. I also got to work with many famous artistes. Now, the film is awaiting to be released, and I believe it will receive good responses from the audience. After ""Priotomeshu"", I am doing this project after 9 years. Is direction more difficult than acting?I feel that working as a director is a tough job. Because when I am working as an actress, my only job is to focus on being in the character I am playing. However, while working as a director, I have tons of things to think about. When and where I will place the camera, when the shoot will end, when the actors will arrive and many more things. A director has to take the responsibility of the whole unit, which makes the job a challenging one.",entertainment
"With ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" now out in theatres, Disney and Sony are actively beginning to develop where the web-slinger's story goes next, according to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige.His comments came in an interview with The New York Times, for which he sat down with former Sony exec and franchise producer Amy Pascal. ""Amy and I and Disney and Sony are talking about — yes, we're actively beginning to develop where the story heads next,"" said Feige, ""which I only say outright because I don't want fans to go through any separation trauma like what happened after 'Far From Home.' That will not be occurring this time.""Feige was alluding to a period between August and September of 2019, following the release of the Tom Holland-led sequel Spider-Man: Far From Home, which saw financial negotiations surrounding the future of the franchise break down between Disney and Sony. Had they not gotten back on track, Feige would have exited his involvement with the Spider-Man films, with Spider-Man himself exiting the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).Pascal subsequently noted in the New York Times interview that there is plenty of more story to explore with Tom Holland's Spider-Man, given the way in which ""No Way Home"" closes out.""At the end of the movie we just made, you see Spider-Man make a momentous decision, one that you've never seen him make before,"" she notes. ""It's a sacrifice. And that gives us a lot to work with for the next film.""However, officially, Holland is not signed on to star in any more movies at this time, even if development on a fourth Spider-Man film following ""No Way Home""  is already in its early stages.In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Holland suggested that he might step behind the camera to produce the fourth film, with a new actor as Spider-Man.

"There has been a sentiment amongst certain sections of people that superhero films, more specifically movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), are the ""death of cinema"". Many think pieces have been written around this concept. I think there is an inclination from a lot of people to turn their nose up at popular entertainment, and I would like to challenge them to go watch a screening of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". Watch the sheer joy this movie unfolds for an audience.Written by Chris Mckenna and Erik Sommers and directed by Jon Watts, ""No Way Home"" picks up right after Mysterio reveals Spider-Man's true identity. As Peter Parker deals with a world where people believe that they have the right to access everything that happens in the lives of famous personalities, all hell breaks loose. He does not know where to turn. With his aunt May, girlfriend MJ, and best friend Ned, he looks for ways to turn back time. Eventually, he requests Dr Strange to cast a memory wipe spell, which goes wrong. As a result, Peter starts getting visitors from other universes.Now, coming back to my timeline, Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man trilogy was my introduction to live-action superhero movies. It showed me that superheroes can be characters with genuine moral conflicts, love, and loss in their lives. Young love was treated with empathy and depth — the upside-down kiss between Peter and MJ, Peter seeing her singing ""I Am Through With Love"" at a jazz club when no one clearly understood how truly special she was, his heartbreak when she starts dating his best friend Harry — these were not just plot points for the makers to pivot the characters onto another timeline, or a crossover of some sort. They had me engrossed in the narrative.The Andrew Garfield era of Spider-Man, however, never quite sat right with me. While Garfield did an amazing job, I wish he got better scripts.Tom Holland's Spider-Man has always been an apprentice. He was very much a kid, who had extraordinary abilities but never really experienced actual conflict and pain, which make superheroes become who they are. With ""No Way Home"", this changes.From the introduction sequence itself, we see an existential crisis beginning to hit Peter. He is now truly coming of age. Although he is still a teenager, and has not yet become disillusioned, he is no longer willing to take instructions from people who are higher up in authority than him or older in age, just because he is told to.""No Way Home"" takes a stab at what it means to be a ""superhero"" — a larger than life figure with great power, and the sacrifices one has to make to keep that power. It is not just a thrilling and emotional end to Peter's high school trilogy in the MCU, but also a smart, fun, and an exciting celebration of everything there is to love about Spider-Man.This is a film that made people laugh, cry, and cheer. After the movie was over, I walked out of the hall to see crowds of people talking excitedly about what they had just seen. There wasn't one person who did not have a smile on their face. At the end of the day, isn't that what you want as a moviegoer?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is now playing in theatres. If you decide to go, stay safe, and don't forget to wear a mask.",entertainment

"The 10 people who died in a stampede at rapper Travis Scott's concert at the Astroworld Festival in Houston last month accidentally suffocated, the Harris County medical examiner ruled on Thursday.The victims, aged 9 to 27 years old, died of compression asphyxia, the examiner's report concluded, essentially crushed to death in the crowd surrounding the stage. Another 300 people were injured among the audience of 50,000 people.Victims were trapped and hemmed in by barricades on three sides, unable to escape as thousands of fans rushed toward the stage while Scott performed. Eyewitnesses said spectators fell to the ground and some were trampled by the crowd.The medical examiner ruled out homicide, or death caused by another person, in all 10 cases.""This re-opens a fresh wound for many families who are still trying to make sense of what happened,"" said Harris County's top executive Lina Hidalgo.""Bharti Shahani suffered a horrific death as she was suffocated within a massive crowd,"" said attorney James Lassiter, who represents the Shahani family. The findings ""confirm Bharti's family's worst fears,"" he said.A spokesperson for Scott declined immediate comment. His attorney and representatives for Live Nation did not reply to requests for comment.A Houston police spokesperson declined immediate comment.The medical examiner's finding could shape the direction of a police criminal investigation into the tragedy, which has shaken Houston and raised issues about crowd control and security at entertainment mega-events.There have been no charges filed by police but at least 200 lawsuits including several by family members of the deceased have been filed against 29-year-old Scott, festival promoter Live Nation Entertainment, the NRG Park concert venue, and others involved in the event.The family of Mirza Danish Baig, 27, sued organizers for negligence and wrongful death, alleging they failed to stop the show ""when it was obvious they had lost complete control of the situation,"" according to their lawyer. At least two other families also filed negligence lawsuits.Compression asphyxia is caused by a force from the front or back preventing the lungs from expanding, said Dr. Ron Albarado, an acute care trauma surgeon, at UT Health Houston. Deaths can occur in about 15-20 minutes in a crowd surging back and forth, he said.What Scott and organizers knew of the unfolding tragedy before ending the concert is part of the police investigation. The concert continued for more than 30 minutes after it was declared a mass casualty event, and after police told the promoter to halt it, Houston Chief Troy Finner has said.Scott was unaware of the full extent of what had happened until the next morning, his attorney has said, and the rapper offered to help with the families' funeral expenses. Festival director and executive producers, not Scott, were responsible for deciding when to end the concert, his attorney has said.  ",entertainment
"Noted singers Sahana Bajpaie, Samantak Sinha, and Sohini Alam will be the stars of a UK-India-Bangladesh collaborative album, ""Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khata"" (The Magpie-Robin's Songbook), featuring contemporary renditions of songs recorded during Bangladesh's Liberation War. Marking the Victory Day of Bangladesh, ""O Buriganga Nadire"", the first single of ""Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khata"", sung by Sohini with arrangement by Samantak, was released today. Sohini is a British-Bangladeshi vocalist whose musical repertoire includes folk, modern, and traditional Bengali songs with a specialisation in Nazrul Sangeet. She has branched out into multi-lingual music in bands, for dance, and for theatre. Sohini's soaring vocals take centre stage in the soulful track, ""O Buriganga Nadire"". With heart-breaking lyrics by Subimal Bhattacherjee, the song was originally sung by noted Indian singer Amar Pal and recorded by Hindustan Records, India's oldest record label, in 1971.Sohini's rendition features Samantak on keyboard, along with Sutanu Sarkar on esraj. Her vocals were recorded by Andrew Glenn at SOAS University of London.  Sahana, who was honoured with The Bengal's Pride Award 2018 at the UK Parliament for her contribution to arts and culture, was brought up and trained in Rabindra Sangeet in Santiniketan. She had spent quite a few years in Dhaka, and is now based in London. Her rendition of the song, ""Akash Kande"" on ""Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khata"", is  arranged by Samantak with Subham Kanjilal on oud and dotara, Avirup Das Bunty on percussion, and Samantak, Subham, and Bunty on backing vocals. Having studied music production in London, Samantak is a prominent musician in West Bengal. He went to The Recording Workshop, a private institution in the UK, with the Charles Wallace Scholarship. He has collaborated as a music arranger with several noted singers. He sang and arranged a rendition of the song, ""O Mor Bangla"", on this album. The track features Prasun Bhattacharya on electric guitar, Sunny Bhattacharya on bass, and Avirup Das Bunty on percussion. ""Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khata"", featuring three tracks, is the dream project of two London-based academics, Somnath Batabyal and Georgie Pope, who both work at SOAS University of London, renowned for its research expertise on the Global South. Somnath has his roots in Dhaka's Gandaria, while Georgie, from the UK, is a musician and an ethnomusicologist, who has been researching the music of Bengal and Assam for the past decade. They are the executive producers of this collaborative album, for which all the tracks are recorded, mixed, and mastered by Alok Chowdhury.""In the summer of 2018, I was sitting with Sahana on the balcony of her house in Santiniketan, where both of us were listening to bird songs. We started talking about what it means to be a Bengali in foreign lands, and what binds us together. Our collective response was, it is music and poetry, and the particular sounds of childhood we carry with us. It was at this moment that the idea for the album was born. The 50th anniversary of the birth of Bangladesh was approaching, and it seemed to be an opportune moment to rejoice in both the struggle and the promise of that time through music,"" says Somnath. ""We are all children of 1971. We have grown up in the shadows and the possibilities of what Bangladesh promised. Collectively, we wanted to hand this treasure to a younger generation.""Through Sahana, the producers were introduced to Sovan Saha, Director, Inreco Entertainment. Hindustan Records is a part of Inreco Entertainment. Producing music since the 1930s, their first recording was the voice of Kobi Guru Rabindranath Tagore. Sovan Saha is the custodian of an extraordinary collection of recordings that he made during 1971 with artistes such as Amar Pal. ""Artistes from both sides of the border collaborated with each other to sing songs for Hindustan Records during Bangladesh's Liberation War. Our album features reimaginings of three such songs from 1971,"" says Sahana. ""We wanted to commemorate the fact that Bangladeshi and Indian singers came together fifty years ago, to sing for Bangladesh's independence. I hope to always be a part of Bangladesh."" ""When he heard of the venture, Sovan Saha was excited and generously opened up his archive for our use. It has been an incredible joy listening to the old recordings and seeing the brilliant creative ideas that Sahana, Samantak, and Sohini have brought to each song,"" mentions Georgie. ""Somnath and I were thinking about a name for the album. We wanted something that would speak to migration and allow the imagination to transcend man-made cartography. Doyel Pakhi is the national bird of Bangladesh and we imagined the songs that the bird would have sung of those days. So, we came up with 'Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khatha' - and, even in translation - 'The Magpie-Robin's Songbook' - it carried the melody.""After ""O Buriganga Nadire"", ""Akash Kande"" will be released on December 25, 2021, and ""O Mor Bangla Re"" will be out on January 1, 2022.

The Daily Star caught up with the artiste to listen to the memories of those days.""Within just a few days of the beginning of the war, Chattogram was under attack. On the midnight of April 28, when we wee already robbed and in the same clothes for ten days, our village home was destroyed.Finding no other way, we started walking towards Betbunia hill in Rangamati, and walked 85 Kilometers in just two days. I was with my 75-year-old Thakuma (grandmother), my Kakima (aunt) who was eight months pregnant, and 36 other family members with three hundred people from our village. We did not have any food with us. However, we then crossed the Subroon border and reached Agartola. From there, we went to Kolkata by train.In May, artiste Swapan Chowdhury informed us that they have formed an association 'Mukti Sangrami Shilpi Sangstha' with Sanjida Khatun, Wahidul Haque along with Mahmuduzzaman Benu, and Debabrata Chowdhury among others. We were invited to join them. After that, we went to 144 Lenin Sarani, which was made the office for practice and rehearsals.Noted intellectuals of Kolkata like Nirendranath Chakraborty, Dipendranath Bandyopadhyay, Debesh Ray, Shankha Ghosh, Proshun Basu, and Amitabh Dasgupta supported us dearly, and they were in the committee as well.While Dalia Noushin, Sharmin Morshed, Rafiqul islam, Kalyani Ghosh, along with Tareq Ali, Enamul Haque, Syed Hasan Imam, Shahin Samad, and Shila Momen were the members of 'Muktir Gaan'.The association decided to hold a fundraising concert for the artistes to create awareness. We decided present ""Rupantorer Gaan"" on stage which was written by Shahriar Kabir, and narrated by Syed Hasan Imam on July 3 at Rabindra Sadan.The aim was to outline history based on the song. The task was not at all easy in the context of contemporary politics. It highlighted the struggles of 1952 to 1971. Mustafa Monowar designed the entire set.On July 4, all of the noted artistes of Kolkata including Aparna Sen, Shambhu Mitra, Tripti Mitra, Debabrata Biswas, Kanika Banerjee, Ashoketaru Bandhyopadhyay, Nilima Sen and Suchitra Mitra among others performed in the fund raising event, where we sang the chorus.During the war, we went to the camps located at the borders, to meet and sing for the war refugees to boost their confidence. We would cover two to three camps every day. The aged people would cry their hearts out, and they would want us to spend more time with us. We would also cover Muktijoddha camps, and they would never let us go without having lunch with them.On the morning of December 6, we were informed that India has recognised Bangladesh as a free nation, and that our national flag will be raised at the high commission. The artistes of 'Mukti Sangrami Shilpi Sangstha' were called to sing the national anthem, ""Amar Shonar Bangla"". We all attended the event with tears of joy. At that time, radio Akashbani Kolkata was flaring with ""Shono ekti Mujiborer Theke Lokkho Mujiborer Konthoshorer Dhoni"" on Angshuman Ray's voice.We came back to Bangladesh in the second week of February, 1972, almost after nine months.The memory is still fresh in my mind, and the emotion cannot be expressed in words.""",entertainment

"Jinnatun Jannat's solo exhibition, ''Naree Shutro'', is currently underway at EMK Center, Dhanmondi. This exhibition is a part of the global campaign, ''16 Days of Activism against Gender-based violence''. The campaign further included a series of virtual discussions, other exhibitions, awareness-raising workshops, and a cultural programme.The artworks on display explore the artist's own self, her home, and her country. They are somewhat inspired by the ideas of American philosopher George Hubert Mead. Jannat has beautifully incorporated the concept of self and emergence as her artworks depict what she feels, how she feels, her own senses, and her emotions expressed from her own perspectives.""My father always emphasised on the idea that the home in my native village would feel different. Growing up, I could relate to what he said, in my own home. This was the beginning of my exploration into native forms, colours, and history, while rediscovering the identity I truly belong to,"" she explained.Jannat also focused on the importance of incorporating traditional art forms in her current work. Most of the artworks on display feature birds, fishes and traditional motifs within incomplete human figures. Some of the works are also inspired by rickshaw art and nakshi katha designs. She has mixed Earth colours with acrylics to create a different style featuring Chinese strokes on paper.The idea behind this exhibition stemmed from her Master's project about identifying oneself. ""The series has been shaped by my everyday experiences and is all about getting back to my roots,"" she added. She began working on the ongoing series during the pandemic. ""I think the biggest takeaway from this exhibition is the story behind each artwork and how the audience decides to interpret it,"" she asserted.Jannat has always been fascinated by cultural heritage, and attempts to reminisce our history through her work. ""Some traditional motifs are already lost and resources were greatly limited during the pandemic. My faculty members were helpful in helping me find these connections and in the future I want to reach out to people who work with these artforms so I can present their stories in a better way,"" she concluded. The exhibition is open to visitors till December 18.",entertainment

"Transforming a house to a home can be challenging. A home's atmosphere should be light-hearted, vibrant, welcoming, and creative. In the quest for the ideal home environment, décor plays a crucial role in expressing personality, bringing in a sense of cosiness and comfort, and harmony in each room.Candles fit into almost every style of surroundings and can be used as beautiful decor to make a house livelier, relaxing and therapeutic for down time. With both scented and unscented candles, the ambience which candles bring in allows the light and smells to impact mood, offer well-being, and create a more personal atmosphere in the practice of various self-care rituals.Coming in various shapes like circular, cylindrical, round, patterns, and also in varying sizes, and packaging, candles can be a luxurious and sophisticated object to integrate into the home's decoration. Many shops like Aarong and Miniso, and online marketplaces like Metaphor, Aura, Candle Cup BD and Newton's Archive offer elegant and sophisticated fragrances, perfect to leave scattered throughout the house and to amplify a relaxing and heart-warming environment. These candles range in designs and sizes, with an aesthetic appeal fitting for every room and mood. Starting from fruity fragrances to floral and sandalwood to natural scents to aromatic and therapeutic ones, there is a scent and design for every purpose.There are multiple ways candles can be used as decorative pieces. Be it as ornamental pieces on their own or as complements to other decorations like paintings, vases, lamps, sculptures, and so on, candles are multidimensional. Candles also come in different colours. For minimalist households, candles reflecting gentle light and neutral hues can be used to add a more personalised and sophisticated touch. On the other hand, using colourful, unusual colours and moulds for a more upbeat style helps maintain the vibrant and active essence of a room.Perhaps the most common association with candles is the dining room and candle-lit dinners. Whether formal or casual, candles can make the dining room feel more pleasant and complete. Unscented candles are ideal for the dining room as different scents (the candles and the food) drifting in the air might not be appetising while having a meal. Taller or cylindrical candlesticks or tall candle holders among some foliage creates a finer and more refined effect. Some smaller yet captivating candle designs might make for an attractive centrepiece with it being too extravagant or over-the-top. Candles can also help in relaxing and unwinding. For instance, the living room should exude a relaxing, friendly, and inviting atmosphere at any given time of day. During the day, fresh scented candles can bring positive energy, while at night, burning candles in the living room can create a warm, relaxing and inviting atmosphere. For a more unique touch, candle wall sconces can be used instead of room lights, or a vast variety of candles can be placed in distinct corners, coffee tables or on top of books to create a gently lit and comforting space.Placing candles in the bathroom can create the illusion of a spa, and add a fresh, clean aroma to the bathroom. To create this spa-like atmosphere, scattering candles of various sizes around the bathtub or placing fresh scented candles on the counter near the sink, would make for a worthwhile relaxation. To generate more serenity, white candles, or coloured candles, can be used to brighten up a neutral coloured environment. However, before the relaxing can actually begin, make sure there is nothing flammable nearby!The lovely smell that permeates across the room when the scented and aromatised candle burns, has a relaxing effect, allowing one to reconnect with themselves without haste. Aromatherapy can create a pleasant workplace by providing a sensory experience. Using not only scented candles but also essential oils like lavender, sandalwood, citronella, rosemary, and lemongrass, can help one focus and improve their overall well-being both physically and psychologically. All these elements combined (diffusers, vaporisers, scented candles and essential oils) contribute to a greater sense of tranquillity and lightness.Candles can be used to complete the decor of a home, create a peaceful ambiance after a long day or for meditation, yoga, eating delectable food, reading your favourite book, listening to music, having friends over for dinner, or simply turning off the lights and being with your thoughts. With all its purposes, candles are a small touch but with a big impact.",life_living
"Although fresh flowers have the power to brighten up any room, while providing aromatherapy, dried flowers have their own distinct and ethereal beauty. Although it might seem as if the only way you can include them in your interior is through vases, that does not have to be the case.Restrained and framed Dried or pressed flowers can be incorporated into wall decor in numerous ways, be it through frames, garlands or wreaths. If you would like to adorn your wall with flowers in a more restrained way without taking up too much space, try pressing flowers with a heavy book and parchment paper before framing it. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.  When you choose flowers for your pressed arrangement, make sure to include a few vibrant focal flowers for the centre, supplemented with some muted filler flowers and leaves for balance. If you want it to be dainty, go for one sole flower. To ease the pressing process, opt for flowers with flat buds only. It is best to pick or buy flowers which are blooming to reduce the amount of colour drained during the pressing process. After you let the flowers dry for a few weeks between the pages of a heavy book and parchment paper, they will be ready to be framed. Transparent frames are usually the best at enhancing pressed flowers as they add a soft and delicate touch.            Photo: Sazzad Ibne Sayed Year-round wreaths Although we tend to associate wreaths with Christmas holidays, adding a wreath to your living space is an acceptable way to brighten up your home all year-round. You can customise your wreath by only adding flowers which complement the colour scheme of the room. Choosing a seasonal theme for your wreath is also an option. If you look forward to spring every year, you can incorporate dried pastel flowers such as roses or lavender.  If you find warm colours associated with autumn comforting, try dried strawflowers and sunflowers for your wreath. If wreaths feel too over the top for you, substitute with dried flower garlands. Fairylike apothecary jars Dried flowers in glass jars have an inherent fairy tale element to them which vibrates a beautiful fragility. Although they can be found in some home decor stores, you can make one yourself with relative ease. All you need is an apothecary or mason jar, some dried flowers and potpourri, and inclusions of your choosing.

If you love the distinct look of potpourri and love catching a whiff of it every now and then, you can add that as well. Non-flower inclusions are all up to you.

"Major US air carriers warned on Wednesday that plans by wireless carriers to use spectrum for 5G wireless services starting January 5 could disrupt thousands of daily flights and cost air passengers $1.6 billion annually in delays.AT&T and Verizon Communications must delay the plans to use C-Band spectrum for 5G wireless services, United Airlines (UAL.O) Chief Executive Scott Kirby said following a US Senate Commerce Committee hearing, saying it could delay, divert or cancel about 4% of daily flights and impact hundreds of thousands of passengers.""It would be a catastrophic failure of government,"" Kirby told reporters.The aviation industry and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters.Last week, the FAA issued new airworthiness directives warning that interference from 5G wireless spectrum could result in flight diversions, but did not quantify the impact. read more""Coming Jan. 5 -- unless something changes -- we will not be able to use radio altimeters at 40-something of the largest airports in the country,"" Kirby said. ""It is a certainty. This is not a debate.""Kirby said it would mean that at major US airports in the event of bad weather, cloud cover or even heavy smog ""you could only do visual approaches essentially.""Trade group Airlines for America said Wednesday that if the FAA 5G directive had been in effect in 2019, ""approximately 345,000 passenger flights, 32 million passengers, and 5,400 cargo flights would have been impacted in the form of delayed flights, diversions, or cancellations.""Southwest Airlines' chief executive, Gary Kelly, told the Senate hearing that if the FAA directive takes effect it ""would be a significant setback"" to its operations.The wireless industry defended the technology.""The aviation industry's fearmongering relies on completely discredited information and deliberate distortions of fact,"" CTIA, a wireless trade group, said.It said that 5G operates safely and without causing harmful interference to aviation operations in nearly 40 countries around the world.The Biden administration is eager to see the issue resolved. White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese met with Federal Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the issue Wednesday, sources told Reuters. The White House and the Transportation Department did not comment.Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn at the hearing urged airlines to work with the wireless carriers to reach agreement.Rosenworcel, who did not comment Wednesday, has said she believes the issues can be resolved and spectrum safely used.In addition to agreeing to delay the commercial launch of C-band wireless service until January 5, AT&T and Verizon in November adopted precautionary measures for six months to limit interference.Aviation industry groups said they were insufficient to address air safety concerns and have made a counterproposal.United's Kirby said the FCC and FAA ""need to get in a room and talk to each other and solve the problem,"" adding that the issue ""cannot be solved on the back of airlines.""A4A said the FAA directive would ""materially disrupt airline operations"" and said cargo operators estimate it ""would have cost them $400 million annually.""The group said ""the annual impact cost to passengers to be approximately $1.59 billion"" of travel delays.Wireless carriers have shown no interest in further delays to using the spectrum, which the industry paid more than $80 billion to acquire.The FAA directives order revising airplane and helicopter flight manuals to prohibit some operations requiring radio altimeter data when in the presence of 5G C-Band wireless broadband signals.The FAA plans to issue further notices to airlines before Jan. 5 offering more detail on the potential interference and is in discussion about which altimeters could be used under the current mitigation plans.

"There is no success without sacrifice. Victory minus struggle. Fifty years have now passed since that glorious day in December 1971 when we achieved victory after a battle for nine months. The sacrifices made during those days of war will forever remain irreplaceable losses for our nation.One can never stand on the ground without firmly holding on the roots. That is one lesson from history we have learned. And, unfortunate it may seem that despite all the exercise involving the preservation of the history of the liberation movement, we have failed to address the issue widely to the younger generation. How we may bring the topic of liberation war to those born decades later is a matter of deep concern, but it has to be done!The Liberation War of 1971 was a people's struggle. Battles were fought at the frontiers, and war raged in the most unthinkable of places. People wholeheartedly supported the freedom movement, sans a few individuals who opposed the spirit of liberation; some abetted and engaged in war crimes.   Those who were witness to the momentous moments of this nation's history, those who took part in the war — freedom fighters — are now among the elderly. Many we have lost, yet their endeavours remain etched in time.While historians embark in their effort to preserving the past. It can be said without an iota of doubt that one must nurture a 'historian' within every individual, especially the younger generation. And perhaps the best way of doing so is through story-telling.Every person witness to the War has unique narratives — some of gallantry, others of sorrow, and loss. Some stories are just trivial matters of everyday lives, yet set in the context, they emerge as an important tool in understanding the past. We must preserve these stories and one of the ways of doing so is perhaps by presenting the human angle to the liberation movement.It will take time for a generation who did not witness the War to come to terms with it as the barriers of time are separating us further still. The practice of transmitting history must remain as a continuous effort and not limited to days of special significances.Many of us grew up listening to the stories of our grandparents, our fathers, mothers, and uncles and aunts. They were not necessarily stories of the freedom movement; perhaps the time has come to make a conscious effort to make our stories relate to the liberation struggle.It is not an easy task, but once stories are absorbed in their spirit, those willing to embark on an academic pursuit can do so on their own. It would be wrong to expect every new individual to become an expert of the War, but it is essential that every individual becomes a treasure trove of stories to pass on to the next generation, not as a history lesson, but a part of our past.",life_living
"A weekend-long extravaganza that was the ultimate medley of song, celebration and fashion, the Bangladesh Couture Week 2021 championed the majesty of Bangladeshi silk in all its forms and glory. Taking place at Edge Gallery of Gulshan North Avenue, the fashion exhibit was a successful instalment and courtesy of the Fashion Design Council of Bangladesh (FDCB) who pieced together the event for the sole purpose of bringing the regal sophistication of a mesh of silk to the fore.The inauguration of the exhibit was carried out by chief guest Dr Dipu Moni, Minister of Education of Bangladesh. In her own words, ""Handloom fabric such as silk, jamdani and muslin are the insignias of Bangladesh, it's what we are known for to the rest of the world. Our honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is the greatest brand ambassador of the traditional clothes and fabrics of Bengal. I laud FDCB's attempt in reviving heritage fabrics through fantastic exhibits like this one which has been dedicated to silk and the government is also playing its part in preserving our traditional crafts and history.""Joining her as another esteemed guest at the exhibit was the Japanese ambassador to Bangladesh Naoki Ito who remained much appreciative of Bangladesh's diverse culture and the FDCB's noble efforts.At the heart of this exhibit that ran between 2nd to 4th December, 17 designers of the fashion council envisioned 17 different concepts and weaved stunning creations, any one of which can easily be housed in a museum. Afsana Ferdousi, for example, glamourized Bengali folk tales of Bon Bibi- the protector goddess of the Sundarbans and 'sheetal pati.' She does so by taking the blooms of Bangladesh's six seasons and expressing them in bold prints against subdued backgrounds that are anything but minimal. Make it all statement was her endgame, a sartorial ideology adopted by many of the other fashion designers as well.Considering Farah Anjum Bari's creations, the designer is an inspired soul who pours her concept of creating oceanic ripples onto beds of organza. Sequins sown in waves give you the illusion of a warm summer day by the sea, standing by the shores, completely mesmerised by how the water catches the sunlight. Farah Anjum Bari's clothes are nostalgic, her designs the epitome of grace.Shahrukh Amin, the debonair designer of the FDCB, was another designer to watch with his posies of flowers stitched strategically onto his masterpieces. Sarah Karim, with her poise and acumen takes the darkness of the timeless black and contrasts it with the pristineness of white to design fascinating cuts and clothes that are the sartorial equivalent of the boho diva.Maheen Khan also shows us a few tricks from her sleeve in her works of art as she reimagines the traditional drape and cut of a Bengali's belle's ultimate garb, the sari. Khan deconstructs the humble blouse and incorporates cropped jackets to make it a two-step wear. She puts an interesting spin on her designs with symmetrical pleats and monochrome colours and drapes the folds of a sari in a much looser, almost hippie style.More artistic designers who took part in the exhibit were Chandana Dewan, Faiza Ahmed, Shaibal Saha, Farzana Nova, Tasfia Ahmed, Sadia Rashid Chowdhury, Rifat Rahman, Rupo Shams, Rima Naaz, Lipi Khandker, Nawshin Khair and, finally, Emdad Hoque — all with their spectacular creations.Bangladesh Couture Week 2021 also took the time to honour 11 celebrities for their charismatic personalities, dedication to style and for being true icons in their own ways. Bangladeshi actors Siam Ahmed and Jaya Ahsan and musician Xefer were some of the awardees.Photo:Fashion Design Council of Bangladesh (FDCB) ",life_living

According to the designer, the entire look was meant to be a visual representation of an Indian Queen, who is equally graceful and strong, nurturing and loving, fierce and bold in all aspects of her life. Both the attire and the matching umbrella were covered in mirrors and embroidery. Upon winning Sandhu took to social media and expressed that she felt 'a sense of empowerment' while wearing the outfit.The concluding 'winning-answer' was to a question asked to all of the final three contestants – What advice would you give to young women watching, on how to deal with the pressures that they face today? Sandhu gave a fitting reply that mostly referred to increasing self-confidence and individuality amongst the youngsters. The answer seemed to have convinced the judges enough to declare her the winner of the occasion.Celebrated comedian, Steve Harvey, hosted the competition. After Sandhu's win was announced, she celebrated with other contestants' on stage, shouting to a camera, ""Chak de Phatte, India,"" a Punjabi exclamation stating, ""Let's do this, India!""",life_living
"Believe it or not, it is possible to get that enviable skin at any age. By incorporating just a few simple habits into your daily routine, you can get clearer, spotless and more youthful skin, with results visible in as little as four weeks. By now, we know all about UV rays and the kind of serious damage it can do to our skin. Therefore, when it comes to sunscreen, there can be no skimping. However, where sunscreen protects you against tanning and premature ageing, it does nothing for the dark spots that occur on your skin as a result of glycation. The process of glycation occurs when too much sugar and too much protein in your diet combines with body heat. Without going too much into the chemistry of it, let it suffice to say that the less sugar you use in your diet, the better your skin will feel and look. By reducing sugar from the above trio, the process of glycation can be reversed, diminishing and then completely wiping out dark spots, wrinkles, the effects of collagen loss and sag from your skin, giving you clear, blemish-free, lifted skin that automatically looks two decades younger. Completely eliminating sugar from our diet is a difficult ask — sugar is tasty and frankly, everywhere. So, what if we told you that there is another way to achieve the same results without altering the sugar level in our diet? Introducing: polyphenols! Polyphenols are some of the most powerful antioxidants found in plants and by harnessing the power of this super molecule, whether in consumption or usage, it is possible to curb the signs of early ageing. Coffee and green tea contain polyphenols, as do nuts, olives and berries. You can use moisturisers and skin serums that contain polyphenols too so that they work their magic from the outside. The stresses of modern life can suck the life out of our health and more often than not, what goes on under the skin is what shows up on the skin. Just some simple healthy habits boost skin health and when skin is presented with the right nutrients, it thanks you in amazing ways. Give it a go.",life_living
"In a fast-paced, materialistic era as such, taking it slow may in fact be better for the world. With this philosophy at its core, Friendship Colours of the Chars celebrated ""A Night of Tradition"" that magnificently interweaved tradition and fashion on Friday, November 26, at Le Meridien, Dhaka.Star Lifestyle was one of the media partners of the event.Friendship Colours of the Chars is a social enterprise of Friendship NGO that works with marginalized women residing in the remotest areas of Bangladesh within the riverine islands. By providing them with vocational training to master the art of handloom, natural dying, block printing, and embroidery, they are empowered to live life with dignity while preserving the culture and tradition of our country, all in an effort to promote slow and sustainable fashion.A Night of Tradition began with opening remarks from Nazra Mahjabeen Sabet, Director of Operations, Nodi Limited, who stated, ""We all have a common goal of making our world a better place with better systems. Friendship Colours of the Chars is the first slow and sustainable fashion brand in Bangladesh formed to promote slow fashion in a fast-moving world, while respecting the history and heritage of old Bengal.""Runa Khan, Founder and Executive Director of Friendship NGO, added, ""The poor cannot afford poor solutions. They need to identify with something beautiful to find the courage to face challenges life throws at them and live with dignity. Our focus remained on providing these people with access to health, education, and income and eventually, Friendship Colours of the Chars was born.""Providing a synopsis of the life of a weaver, the first performance was a poetry recitation synchronised with a performance depicting rural life. The minimalistic garments featured in soothing shades of white perfectly drew the image of the simple and ordinary lives of people living in remote regions of Bangladesh – peaceful and tranquil with no hustle and bustle.The fashion walks emphasised on six broad categories, the first of which was the most traditional of human power tools – handloom. Following eco-friendly procedures, all fabric is a product of this traditional technique combined with manual dexterity and skills of the weavers.Each roll of yarn not only weaves wearable clothing but also the stories of the women behind their making. The simplicity of the attires in pale colours was indeed a reflection of the purity and modesty that lies behind their creation.The second fashion line represented the finest handmade creation of Bangladeshi tradition – Jamdani. The articles of clothing donned in the runway not only captured the regal features of Jamdani but also encapsulated decades of rich history. They are made from the purest of cotton replete with a mix of complex patterns consisting of geometric, plant, and floral motifs.Friendship Colours of the Chars tailors not just traditional saris handed down to us from the past but also modern ready wear for the present, which was the theme for the next fashion walk. As the models strutted down the runway in attires that are up-to-the-minute chic yet made using traditional methods, popular singer Mehreen Mahmud added fervour to the event with her energetic performance.Also present in the event was Afsana Mimi, actress and director of Shilpakala Academy who graciously emphasised on the value of love, respect, and pride that is involved in the making of these articles of clothing, jewellery, and accessories.Pure Bengal silk is a reflection of the silky rivers flowing throughout our country and the next fashion line paid tribute to this fabric. Adorning unique designs, wax prints, block prints, patterns, and embroidery, it demonstrated a sublime blend of slow fashion and contemporary style entwined with sheer elegance.Following this, the aura of the event turned cool as it focused on one colour of the rainbow – indigo. Indigo dyeing is one of the purest forms of natural dye and is etched in our history that dates centuries back. The mix and match of outfits that ranged from traditional to modern not only represented slow fashion, but history wrapped in blue hues.Friendship Colours of the Chars is spreading its reach across the globe to Europe, representing the infusion of Bangladeshi heritage and slow fashion in foreign lands. Their store in Luxembourg is the flagship retail outlet that adapts to trending global styles, where the shopping space reflects our culture.Marc Elvinger, Co-Chair of Friendship International regarded it ""as the most beautiful shop in town"" accentuating the fine collection of popping colours and quality attires. The last performance of the evening provided a synopsis of modish attires that are exported to Europe, straight from the chars.  The show ended with the gracious presence of Imam Hassan, the Lead Designer behind the attires for the evening and concluding remarks from esteemed Fashion Designer Chandra Shekhar Saha, who noted, ""Fashion is dynamic, that is altering with dignity, colour, perception, creativity, ideas, and innovation. But slow fashion pulls us back to reality and reminds us that we are in fact very close to nature.""A Night of Tradition was a celebration of our pride and heritage along with the rise of slow fashion in Bangladesh. It brought under limelight the work of unsung heroes, the women of the chars who use these skills to stitch their own passion and compassion into beautiful hand-woven fabric, defining what it means by slow and sustainable fashion in its rawest form.

"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looked elated as he welcomed all to this year's British Curry Awards, known as the Oscars for the global curry industry, held at the Battersea Evolution Center, London. On this star-studded event organised by the British-Bangladeshi entrepreneur Enam Ali MBE in association with Just Eat, Boris Johnson in a video message said, ""The global recognition of those talented people of the curry industry is truly mind-blowing. Even more gratifying is the fact that in the last two years, in the midst of the most difficult days of the nation, these people selflessly and persistently provided foods to our NHS and to people from door to doors saving millions of invaluable lives"".Welcoming all corners to the gala event that two decades back actually began in the hands of some notable British-Bangladeshi entrepreneurs, who do control the best part of the British curry industry, and has today become one of the national festivals in Britain, the British Prime Minister expressed his heartfelt thanks and felicitations to all the restaurateurs, chefs and waiters working for the industry.Nominated by people, best of the restaurateurs from all over Britain flocked to the capital city with a dream for winning the 'Curry Oscar' a jewel in the crown at the most rousing festival of the year. To add to the splendour of the event, celebrities from sports, entertainment, culture, and politics made their presence.The organisers of the festival dedicated the entire festival to the memory of the pioneers, businessmen and workers of the British curry industry who lost their lives during the difficult COVID-19 pandemic in the last one and a half years.   Notably, more than 90 per cent of the British curry industry, else known as the Asian and Indian curry industry spread across the UK, was created by the Bangladeshi entrepreneurs. Although Bangladeshi restaurants won most of the awards in the previous year, this year out of 12 categories, they bagged four, while two went to Pakistani and the rest to Indian restaurants.British Curry Awards 2021 Winners are —Best Restaurant Scotland: Dishoom, North East: Mumtaz Restaurant, North West: Asha's, East Midlands: Montaz Newmarket, West Midlands: Pushkar Restaurant, Wales: Purple Poppadom, South East: Chez Mumtaz, South West: Prithvi Restaurant, London Central and City: Benares, London– Outer & Suburbs: Shampan Bromley, Best Newcomer: Mathura Restaurant, Best Delivery Restaurant/Takeaway: Maliks Express Kitchen and Most Innovative Restaurant Concept: Khai Khai Indian Restaurant.",life_living
"Rarely does anyone say no to kebabs. Whether it is the traditional version or the taste of a foreign cuisine, we all love the taste of spicy charred meat on pita bread every now and then. So, what makes Amish the answer to our kebab cravings? Glad you asked.Amish is perfect for takeaways and/or gathering of a small group. Although we have accepted kebab shops to look a bit messy and greasy, Amish proves us wrong. With a polished look inside out, it wipes off any hygiene question you may have by offering a live kitchen experience. The kebab meat is carved off of a circulating heated cylinder and assembled right before your eyes.Next notable fact is the menu itself. Again with a very refined look, Amish offers a limited number of options with only the best of their creation; quality over quantity.Kebabs are available in both chicken and beef variants, and you may choose to have it as a wrap or between sub-breads. You can also choose to adjust the spice level. Chips and meat, on the other hand, is doner with a poutine twist to it. This dish is loaded with the meat of your choice along with fries and house-special sauce. Sounds like love in a box, doesn't it?Last but not the least, Amish has probiotic yoghurt drinks as the perfect complement to your meal.In conversation with one of the owners, Faisal Khan, we got to know the story behind the beginning of Amish. It turns out that in 2020, this close-knit group of friends came up with an investment plan that would require their involvement and keep them together.""We are all busy with our lives and with time, people are bound to grow apart. Amish came as an attempt to keep us all together,"" he said, and added, ""I hope I don't scare you, but Amish is actually owned by 18 people.""The atmosphere around Amish seems to reflect the vibe it was created from. You can catch up with a friend, stop for a quick meal on the go, or just unwind by yourself at the end of the day. This is probably why despite being relatively new, it is growing in popularity rather fast.With the winter approaching soon, make sure you don't miss out on the 'meatiest doner kebabs in town.'Essentials —Location: Shop No. #2 [Ground Floor] Army Market, ECB Chattar, Manikdi, Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka-1206Phone:01321-159000Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/amishproteenPhoto: Amish",life_living
"With approximately 296 restaurants on board, Munchies is the first delivery service offering to serve all night long – from 8PM to 6AM! Not only does it deliver after hours, the options available at Munchies is not subject to any area-wise distance. No matter what part of the city you reside in, if you order you will be served.Anit Kumar Das, Nafisa Anjum Apala and Tamim Mridha are well-recognised names in their own respective fields who came together to form Munchies. Their first delivery initiative was called 'Now' that worked to transport emergency items to people during the initial months of lockdown in 2020.Within the next few months, they extended their services from essentials to food, and launched 'Munchies' in January 2021. A valid question here is, ""Do we really need another food delivery service?"" Apparently we do, and Munchies showed us why.In our country, the concept of ordering food and groceries online was first introduced in 2013, and has almost completely changed our shopping experience. Following its success, many companies entered the market and it quickly became rather competitive.However, these conventional delivery services do not operate during late hours of the night, and well, our food cravings do not work by the clock. Munchies basically presents itself as the one-stop solution for all the night owls, sudden cravings, unexpected guests, or some urgent requirements.Putting this unique idea into work could not have been easy. Luckily, we were able to hear a little about this journey from one of the three founders, Anit Kumar Das.""Doubts were definitely there. With no previous data to rely on, we knew Munchies could be a hit or miss. But we eventually decided to go for it."" said Das.""There were quite a few challenges in the beginning. First was the fact that mainstream restaurants do not operate at night. So it took a great deal of convincing to get them to agree. Also due to the ongoing pandemic, many restaurants were suffering from losses. Collaborating with us also worked in their favour."" Since delivery services do not work at night, riders of Munchies also have to face several check posts around the city.Munchies is probably one of the most user-friendly websites you can come across. In the restaurant section, you will find food categorised according to the cuisine and not just by name. This makes choosing and comparing a lot easier. The 'safety and hygiene' section stocks generous varieties of surgical masks, gloves, sanitisers and several items of personal hygiene. The best part is you can order from more than one section at the same time. So, antacid can accompany your biriyani next time.Other than this, you will also find snacks, beverages, ice cream, instant and frozen items, etc. Munchies helpline is highly responsive and has been able to help many of its customers in need.Das recalled one such incident when talking to us. ""We got a call asking if we could deliver some prescribed medicine. The caller's mother had fallen ill but they were unable to access any pharmacy at the moment. We asked them to send the prescription to us or our rider and once they did, we got it from a shop nearby."" Another time, they were able to deliver sanitary napkin to a girl in a similar situation. ""It is times like these and the warm feedback of our customers that has allowed us to grow as much as we have within such a short period of time,"" he added.

"""Food, especially good food, brings people together. The Mediterranean diet and the Italian tradition include the notion of eating together and spending quality time with family and friends,"" the ambassador said. ""And this is also what we have done on this event, by bringing people from various international, local, and business communities together.""And hence, the residence became a vibrant and lively place, with laughter and cheers and friends catching up, with the lawn hosting a number of stalls where cooks (mostly people from the Italian community in Bangladesh), made and presented the guests with delicacies of the country — from pizza and risotto to gnocchi (often referred to as Italian dumpling) and cotolette di melanzane (eggplant cutlets) and bagna cauda (a dip that is often served with vegetables).In the heart of it all is of course Mediterranean diet, which is recognised by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, along with the art of Neapolitan 'Pizzaiuolo', the traditional culinary art of the preparation and the baking of the dough.Beatrice Kaldun, head of the office and UNESCO representative to Bangladesh, was also present during this event and spoke of these heritages in her speech.The Daily Star was one of the media partners of the event. Mediterranean diet promotes healthy eating and healthy living. It is a broader concept than people sometimes make it to be. It is a heritage, comprising of various skills, rituals, traditions, etc. related to not just the production and cooking of food, but also the sharing and consumption of food. As for the choice of the food items, it places a lot of emphasis foods like fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, fish, and olive oil. Consumption of dairy and meat products is also there, but in relatively smaller extents. Hence, the Mediterranean diet is often regarded as a healthy diet and lifestyle, nourishing not just the body with nutritious food, but also the mind, with the concept of eating together and strengthening community and family bonding.This year the theme of World Week of Italian Cuisine was 'tradition and perspectives of Italian cuisine: awareness and enhancement of food sustainability'. The theme involves, among other things, a wide range of issues related to biodiversity, food diversity, biosphere reserves, and sustainable agricultural practices.The Week also raised awareness against the Nutri-Score system of labelling on food packaging, which categorises food products on a five-colour scale according to their calculated nutritional scores. It has been argued that this system may provide a vague and distorted image of many Mediterranean foods which are generally considered to be very healthy.""Extra virgin olive oil, which has many health benefits, has been deemed as being rather unhealthy (due to its fat content),"" ambassador Enrico Nunziata exemplified. ""Now of course, if you are using it for frying in large quantities every day, it is bad. It really depends on how you are using it and how much you are consuming, but a direct negative label does not take into account all that and may negatively influence consumers in their purchases.""Be it issues like food sustainability and biodiversity, or the debate of the aforementioned food labelling, or the protection of intangible cultural heritages, the World Week of Italian Cuisine tackled them all.And the food fiesta at the ambassador's residence had been a medium to bring forward these conversations, in the most delightful and charming manner, with the help of delicious food and celebrations of the Mediterranean diet and Italian cuisine.

"Baking is often therapeutic. Dare I say, bread baking is also addictive! Those who have tried their hand in bread baking can surely resonate with the above statements. As for those who have not, I suggest you give it a go. Even if a kitchen fail occurs, rest assured the procedure would at least calm your mind. The entire process of bread baking is so beautiful, and although it may take several hours to make at home, the result is worth it as there is no aroma better than the smell of freshly baked goodies in my accord! For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.  There is something utterly satisfying about kneading the soft dough and giving it time to rest for as long as it requires, then finally watching it rise beautifully in the oven — a true labour of love. Fear not, because time is the only complex element in this elaborate process. Bread also happens to be a quintessential staple all over the world, and thus, several countries have their own type of breads that are representatives of the country. Thus, here are four bread recipes handpicked from around the world for you to savour. ITALIAN CIABATTA This soft and tender bread is infamous for being hard to make at home. If you think likewise and the thought of baking ciabatta at home intimidates you, then this recipe shall be your ultimate saviour! It requires only a handful of pantry ingredients and if followed correctly, you shall master the art of bread baking in no time. Originating in Italy, ciabatta is best enjoyed with a drizzle of pure extra virgin olive oil, a light sprinkling of salt and freshly sliced tomatoes. To enhance the flavour even further, you can rub a slice of garlic on the slices of bread. Ciabatta also makes a great base for bruschetta or crostini topped with juicy tomatoes, olives, and basil.                Ingredients 2½ cups bread flour 2 tsp instant yeast 1 tsp salt 3 tbsp olive oil 1¼ cup lukewarm water Method Drop the yeast in one cup of water and leave it for 10 minutes in order to activate. In a large bowl, add flour, salt, and a couple tablespoons of olive oil and mix to combine. Add in the yeast and water mixture into the bowl and start stirring everything with a wooden spoon. As the dough comes together, start mixing with your hands. This tends to be very sticky so you may oil your palms. Add the remaining water in little amounts as you go. Stretch the dough, drop it back and then push it against you with the help of your palm. Be careful about not tearing the dough and continue kneading for 8–10 minutes.  Once done, the dough should be incredibly light and soft. Slip in the prepared dough into a greased bowl. Cover this and leave it to proof for two hours in a warm place. After two hours, the dough should triple in size. Place the dough on a floured surface and lightly stretch it to a slender rectangle. Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise and cover it again for 15 minutes. At this point, preheat your oven at 170°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Gently place the slices of dough on it and bake them separately for approximately 20 minutes. Once done, allow them to cool slightly, just enough to cut through and enjoy while still warm with your favourite toppings!           FRENCH BAGUETTE This French classic is well-known for its length, crispy crust and chewy interior. Baguette is yet another bread recipe that sounds complicated, but is actually possible to master with practice. The distinguishing factor in all bread recipes is the process and this fool-proof recipe works every time without failure. Baguette is widely popular all over the world and every household has their own way of consuming it. It is a great one to make garlic bread or cheesy toasts, among several other ways in which it can be enjoyed. Baguettes also complement a hearty soup or stew really well. The tall and slender shape of a baguette makes it perfect to make stuffed bread boats as well.            Ingredients 3½ cups flour 1½ cup warm water 1½ tsp yeast 1 tsp sugar 2 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil Method Stir in sugar and yeast into warm water and leave it for five minutes or until the top is frothy. Sprinkle salt onto the flour and mix; pour in the yeast and water mixture into this and stir with a spatula until it comes together. Then, knead the dough with your hands for 6 – 8 minutes. It should be very sticky; you may add flour, not too much, as you go. After the end of the kneading process, the dough should be stretchy and elastic. Scrape the dough with the help of a spatula and drop it in an oiled bowl. Brush the ball of dough with more oil and cover it before allowing it to rest for two hours. After that duration, the dough should puff up and double in size. Generously flour your work surface and drop the dough on it. Knead for a couple more minutes incorporating more flour as you knead. In the end, you should have a light and supple dough. Divide the dough into three equal portions and work with one at a time. Roll and twist the dough, stretching it as well to make a long cylindrical shape. Flour your baking tray and place the loaves on them individually. Flour the top as well and make slits at the top; cover and let it rest for another hour. Meanwhile, take an ovenproof pan and place it at the bottom of your oven while it preheats at 180°C. Once the dough has risen, place it in the middle rack of your oven and pour in cold water in the empty baking dish that has been preheating at the bottom. This will generate steam that helps create that classic crispy exterior and chewy interior. Bake this for 30 minutes and allow it to cool for 10 minutes before slicing in.           KOREAN SAUSAGE BREAD This delicious and cheesy bread recipe is a snack on its own, which is stuffed with sausages, bell pepper, mushroom and corn, all resting on a soft bread made from scratch. To top it off, there is mozzarella cheese atop that creates the most gorgeous cheese-pull when torn apart.    Munching on this delicious snack will make you think of Korean street food. This one is delicious as it is but you may drizzle some barbeque sauce, or a combination of mustard and ketchup for that final touch.  Ingredients For the bread — 2 tsp yeast 1 tbsp sugar ½ cup warm milk 1 egg 2 tbsp oil 2 cups flour 1 tsp salt For the topping — 6 sticks sausages ½ cup boiled corn kernels ¼ cup chopped mushrooms ¼ cup chopped bell peppers 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper 1 tsp paprika ½ tsp chilli flakes ½ tsp dried oregano ½ cup mayonnaise ¼ cup grated cheddar cheese ¼ cup grated mozzarella 1 egg Method To prepare the bread, mix milk, sugar, and yeast and leave it for 10 minutes. Mix this concoction with flour, salt, oil and one beaten egg; combine everything until it forms a dough. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a clean bowl drizzled with oil. Massage the top and sides of the dough with oil and allow it to rest for an hour while covered. Meanwhile, make the stuffing. Mix corn, mushroom and bell pepper along with the condiments, mayonnaise, and grated cheddar cheese. Once the dough has rested sufficiently and risen, knead it with more flour to make it smooth. Shape it into a long cylinder and divide into six equal pieces. Roll out each piece into an oval and place one sausage on it. Encase the sausage entirely with the dough and make 5-6 slits by cutting in through up until the length of the sausage, leaving dough at the base. Pull and twist each disc of sausage covered with bread outwardly so that you have a wide base. Allow this to rest again covered for 15 minutes. After that, brush the tops and sides with a beaten egg and spoon over the prepared mixture on top. Sprinkle over grated mozzarella cheese and bake them in a preheated oven at 170°C for 20-25 minutes before biting in. VENEZUELAN BREAD This fancy Venezuelan bread is nothing short of eye candy. Rolled with layers of soft bread and bacon with a sprinkling of raisins and olives, baking this will make you want to do it repeatedly. It is usually prepared in Venezuela during the holidays and typically contains ham, which has been replaced with smoked bacon in this recipe. This unique bread is delicious as it is but can be the perfect accompaniment in any meal, whether breakfast or dinner. You may also spread a thin layer of mustard over it and munch on it as a snack, or serve this as a side dish to supplement a full meal. Ingredients 1 cup warm milk 2 tsp dry yeast ¼ cup sugar 2 eggs ¼ cup melted butter 4 cups flour 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil 10 slices smoked bacon ½ cup sliced olives ¼ cup raisins Method Mix milk, yeast, and a teaspoon of sugar and leave it to rest for 10 minutes. Once the surface is foamy, add in one egg and melted butter to it and combine. In a large bowl, add flour, salt, and sugar and pour in the mixture. Mix it until a dough is formed and knead it for 8-10 minutes. Roll the dough smoothly into a ball and let it prove in a greased bowl covered for an hour. After an hour, it should double in size. Deflate it and roll the dough into a large rectangle. Cover the surface heavily with slices of bacon leaving some empty space on the sides. Generously sprinkle over chopped olives and raisins. Roll the dough tightly and pinch the seams; let it rest again for 45 minutes while covered. After that, transfer the loaf of bread onto a greased baking tray and brush all the exposed sides with a beaten egg. Pierce the top and sides with a fork to allow steam to escape. Bake this in a preheated oven at 160°C and let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting in.

Ingredients 3½ cups flour 1½ cup warm water 1½ tsp yeast 1 tsp sugar 2 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil Method Stir in sugar and yeast into warm water and leave it for five minutes or until the top is frothy. Sprinkle salt onto the flour and mix; pour in the yeast and water mixture into this and stir with a spatula until it comes together. Then, knead the dough with your hands for 6 – 8 minutes. It should be very sticky; you may add flour, not too much, as you go. After the end of the kneading process, the dough should be stretchy and elastic. Scrape the dough with the help of a spatula and drop it in an oiled bowl. Brush the ball of dough with more oil and cover it before allowing it to rest for two hours. After that duration, the dough should puff up and double in size. Generously flour your work surface and drop the dough on it. Knead for a couple more minutes incorporating more flour as you knead. In the end, you should have a light and supple dough. Divide the dough into three equal portions and work with one at a time. Roll and twist the dough, stretching it as well to make a long cylindrical shape. Flour your baking tray and place the loaves on them individually. Flour the top as well and make slits at the top; cover and let it rest for another hour. Meanwhile, take an ovenproof pan and place it at the bottom of your oven while it preheats at 180°C. Once the dough has risen, place it in the middle rack of your oven and pour in cold water in the empty baking dish that has been preheating at the bottom. This will generate steam that helps create that classic crispy exterior and chewy interior. Bake this for 30 minutes and allow it to cool for 10 minutes before slicing in.           KOREAN SAUSAGE BREAD This delicious and cheesy bread recipe is a snack on its own, which is stuffed with sausages, bell pepper, mushroom and corn, all resting on a soft bread made from scratch. To top it off, there is mozzarella cheese atop that creates the most gorgeous cheese-pull when torn apart.    Munching on this delicious snack will make you think of Korean street food. This one is delicious as it is but you may drizzle some barbeque sauce, or a combination of mustard and ketchup for that final touch.  Ingredients For the bread — 2 tsp yeast 1 tbsp sugar ½ cup warm milk 1 egg 2 tbsp oil 2 cups flour 1 tsp salt For the topping — 6 sticks sausages ½ cup boiled corn kernels ¼ cup chopped mushrooms ¼ cup chopped bell peppers 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper 1 tsp paprika ½ tsp chilli flakes ½ tsp dried oregano ½ cup mayonnaise ¼ cup grated cheddar cheese ¼ cup grated mozzarella 1 egg Method To prepare the bread, mix milk, sugar, and yeast and leave it for 10 minutes. Mix this concoction with flour, salt, oil and one beaten egg; combine everything until it forms a dough. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a clean bowl drizzled with oil. Massage the top and sides of the dough with oil and allow it to rest for an hour while covered. Meanwhile, make the stuffing. Mix corn, mushroom and bell pepper along with the condiments, mayonnaise, and grated cheddar cheese. Once the dough has rested sufficiently and risen, knead it with more flour to make it smooth. Shape it into a long cylinder and divide into six equal pieces. Roll out each piece into an oval and place one sausage on it. Encase the sausage entirely with the dough and make 5-6 slits by cutting in through up until the length of the sausage, leaving dough at the base. Pull and twist each disc of sausage covered with bread outwardly so that you have a wide base. Allow this to rest again covered for 15 minutes. After that, brush the tops and sides with a beaten egg and spoon over the prepared mixture on top. Sprinkle over grated mozzarella cheese and bake them in a preheated oven at 170°C for 20-25 minutes before biting in. VENEZUELAN BREAD This fancy Venezuelan bread is nothing short of eye candy. Rolled with layers of soft bread and bacon with a sprinkling of raisins and olives, baking this will make you want to do it repeatedly. It is usually prepared in Venezuela during the holidays and typically contains ham, which has been replaced with smoked bacon in this recipe. This unique bread is delicious as it is but can be the perfect accompaniment in any meal, whether breakfast or dinner. You may also spread a thin layer of mustard over it and munch on it as a snack, or serve this as a side dish to supplement a full meal. Ingredients 1 cup warm milk 2 tsp dry yeast ¼ cup sugar 2 eggs ¼ cup melted butter 4 cups flour 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil 10 slices smoked bacon ½ cup sliced olives ¼ cup raisins Method Mix milk, yeast, and a teaspoon of sugar and leave it to rest for 10 minutes. Once the surface is foamy, add in one egg and melted butter to it and combine. In a large bowl, add flour, salt, and sugar and pour in the mixture. Mix it until a dough is formed and knead it for 8-10 minutes. Roll the dough smoothly into a ball and let it prove in a greased bowl covered for an hour. After an hour, it should double in size. Deflate it and roll the dough into a large rectangle. Cover the surface heavily with slices of bacon leaving some empty space on the sides. Generously sprinkle over chopped olives and raisins. Roll the dough tightly and pinch the seams; let it rest again for 45 minutes while covered. After that, transfer the loaf of bread onto a greased baking tray and brush all the exposed sides with a beaten egg. Pierce the top and sides with a fork to allow steam to escape. Bake this in a preheated oven at 160°C and let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting in.

"Mental health condition is an important aspect of our existence. It incorporates everything from our emotional state of being to our psychological and social well-being. Our mental health, positive or negative, affects how we think, make life changing decisions or even who we choose to be friends with. It is extremely important at every stage of our lives, from early childhood through adolescence to even adulthood.  There is no way, that we can skip maintenance of our psychiatric needs at any given point and still expect to live healthy and functioning lives. ""And this message needs to get through,"" says Rehnuma- E-Jannat, Psychological Counsellor, PHWC (Psychological Health and Wellness Clinic).  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.  Shabab Sabbir, a 28-year-old from Wari, Old Dhaka, is a graphics designer by day and student by night. His full-time schedule impedes him from spending quality time with friends or even family. Additionally, with the pandemic hovering over, his schedule somehow became shoddier than ever, and Sabbir was no longer living a normal life – a common complaint by loved ones. He was not sleeping properly or feeling any attraction towards his favourite meals. Most of the time he was found lying on the couch, fatigued, tensed and irritable. His parents became concerned, not knowing what to do, they consulted with neighbours first, who referred a specialist to the family. Today, Sabbir is back on his feet, thanks to the well-wishers, directing his family to the right course of action. Having completed his MBA successfully, he is pursuing better work opportunities elsewhere, one that matches his depth and competence. Sabbir has finally learned ways to spend quality time with loved ones, even amidst a hectic schedule, and has also taken up new hobbies, ones which he had been keen on adopting for long. Was there any fairy-tale like enchantment involved…? ""Not at all,"" Jannat reminds us, ""Sabbir had been suffering from 'untreated borderline depression' for years, which got worse during the frenzied pandemic, but with consistent therapy he was thankfully able to get back on his feet, leading a healthy lifestyle once again."" Jannat added on to say, ""Most of the time the answer is very easy. All a person has to do is meet with a psychologist or a psychiatrist and talk their way through mental health obstructions.""            Shamima Akter, Psychological Counsellor, PHWC, further breaks down the process for us. ""Mental health has been a long unaddressed issue in this part of the continent, 'a topic', which we do not feel free to discuss at all because of the associated stigma. ""People consulting mental health practitioners are termed derogatively as 'pagol' and their medics as 'pagol er daktar.' It's so demeaning! We do not realise that physical and mental health actually go hand in hand, if one is not satisfactory, then the other is equally affected."" According to both the psychologists, many patients who suffer from borderline mental dysfunctions could be easily treated with light therapies such as consultation, and one-to- one sessions with the practitioners. Instead, the patients 'prefer/choose' to hide their conditions in fear of the associated stigma, making the condition worse.           ""Mental health is as important as physical health, if we go to the doctor for fever or a cough, then we should also go to a therapist when we feel anxious or agitated. A consultant can deduce the real reasons behind our problems and help in overcoming the unwanted condition,"" revealed Akter. Finally, all being said, we assume that in the 21st century, people should be more empathetic towards people suffering from psychological distress, as they are to any other medical disorder, and should be 'informed and educated' enough to be able to direct the longsuffering, to a registered mental health clinic, if and when required.

"While we are all familiar with the common methods to nurture hair that include oiling, shampooing, conditioning, applying packs, and various hair treatments, what is scalp detox? Does one really need it?Scalp detox is essentially the method of deep cleansing the scalp to get rid of built-up debris and rebalance the pH of the skin. Over time, despite our regular cleansing routine, product, dirt, sweat, and oil can clog our hair follicles creating an unfavourable environment for the hair. Thus, a scalp detox is needed occasionally.""The skin of our head is simply an extension of the skin on our face. And just like we would exfoliate or scrub our face from time to time, our scalp requires the same care,"" explained Farzana Shakil, Beauty Expert and Image Consultant.Scalp detox is not very popular in our region but with time as advances are made and research unravels new techniques of personal care, detoxing the scalp seems to make its way to the list of necessities. Furthermore, the hot and humid climate of our country prompts problems such as itchiness, stickiness, and dandruff that calls for a refresh.""Detoxing the scalp promotes blood stimulation, which in turn improves the scalp health. Just like plants require fertile soil to grow, our hair also needs a healthy scalp for its nourishment. To attain this, just shampooing is often not enough,"" Farzana further explained.Our body has an amazing mechanism that signals us when something is off. Likewise, when you can feel noticeable build-up and debris along with itching and flaking on the scalp, it may be time for a detox. Hair feeling waxy or oily is another telling sign that a detox is needed.Hair detox can be done once a month or more or less often as required. This will depend on a variety of other lifestyle factors such as how often you wash your hair, how oily your scalp is, your exercise routine, and whether or not you cover your hair. Environmental factors should also be taken into consideration such as the level of pollution in your area and its climate.  However, be careful about overdoing it especially for those who have dry or damaged hair strands or if you have sensitive or broken skin on the scalp. The method used for detoxing the scalp is another aspect that will dictate its frequency.  There are several products and home remedies that can be applied for a proper and effective scalp detox. Apple cider vinegar, scrubbing products, aloe vera, and sugar are all viable options. However, one must be wary about using such products because everyone's skin is different. Thus, it is advisable to do a skin patch test first.""Some other options for detoxing the scalp include clarifying shampoo, friction massage, and soft scrub. Detoxification will keep the hair clean and healthy while eliminating dead skin cells and unclogging hair follicles,"" added Farzana Shakil.   Detoxing the scalp forms a favourable environment for hair to receive all the nourishment it requires, creating optimal conditions to thrive. If done correctly, adding this to your beauty regimen will let you dazzle all with those luscious locks.

"The key lies in your muscles. At rest, 1 pound of muscle burns three times as many calories every day just to sustain itself—and a lot of those calories that muscle burns off come from fat storage units. Muscle is constantly burning fat off!Now before I go any further, I know most women are afraid to hear the word muscle, because that means getting bulky like men. One must realise, muscles can get stronger without getting bigger. Women have very low testosterone (the hormone responsible for making men bulk up). This is why when women weight train, their result is a natural lean and tone shape.  For men who crave to get big: increasing the size of the muscle almost inevitably increases strength. So it all comes down to the specific training technique as per your body's need.Why be obsessed with muscle?Muscles are essential for maintaining how we breathe, how we move, metabolism, and posture. It's simple, the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism.Decrease depression —Resistance exercise training was associated with a 45 percent reduction in multiple depressive symptoms (according to a meta-analysis of 33 randomized controlled trials).Boost brain performanceTraining for muscle increases neurotrophic factors in the brain. Just 30 minutes of exercise increases this 2-3 fold. These cause your brain to make new neurons in areas involved in learning/memory. They also repair damaged neurons.Fight fat storageMuscles are more metabolically efficient than fat mass, allowing you to burn more calories at rest. Clinical data shows that your metabolic rate is increased up to 72 hours after strength-training exercise. This means that you are still burning additional calories hours and even days after your workout.Insulin ResistanceBy partnering the powerful combination of whole food nutrition with strength training, insulin resistance can be reversed.  Strength training stimulates greater glucose metabolism during and right after a workout.Weight training triggers an adaptive response for more muscle and thus greater metabolic potential for the next workout. This compounding effect leads to improved insulin sensitivity due to the improvements in muscle strength.Three must-do muscle building exercises I am obsessed with three specific moves. And I know that once you learn it and see just how strong you actually are…you will fall in love with weight training too. Squat Nothing challenges your central nervous system more than a squat. It pushes you to the edge and helps engage your entire system. This full body compound exercise is a tool for gaining strength, and mobility. Learn the correct form and practice daily. Deadlift Sounds scary but this compound exercise is crucial for lower back strength. Weak back muscle is a dangerous condition we must prevent. Beginners should start with low weight and work with higher reps to build balance in lower back, hips, and leg muscles. Bench-press This is a functional upper body exercise for women and men. Bench-press exercises comes in several variations used to target all large muscle groups.           Final thoughts Strength training means slowing and reversing the aging process at the cellular and genetic level, increase your energy, protect against the effects of aging, improve insulin resistance (the kindling for all sorts of diseases), and improve brain function. Exercise can reverse your biological age by nearly a decade, give you more energy, maintain a healthy lifestyle, help you avoid aches and pains, and protect your brain and cognitive ability. A busy lifestyle has become the new definition for success. Sleep deprived, back pain, and fatigue are the new normal. And off course, everyone hates their tummy fat, right? This harmful thought pattern has become the unseen poison of our society. But you can start the change from today. Strength changes everything. Be a muscle maniac!

"Acne is dreaded by most teens, but by the time you are an adult, its simply an unwelcome guest that's far outstayed its welcome. Acne happens for a lot of different reasons and so, many of those reasons overlap one another that you cannot always find the exact culprit. Our mothers and our grandmothers before them have gone through similar issues and they had no LED face therapies and anti-acne facials to turn to. Their kitchens were their havens and that's where they mastered the cure to this age-old pesky problem. And that's exactly where we are heading right now, to give you some tried and tested home remedies to kiss, or rather, kick, acne goodbye!Apple Cider Vinegar A mild acidic vinegar, made from the unfiltered juices of pressed apples, is said to have bacteria killing properties that might also reduce inflammation and improve the appearance of the scars caused by acne. While there is no evidence to support the claim that apple cider vinegar directly cures acne, vinegar does fight bacteria and fungi, thereby proving its effectiveness.Honey and Cinnamon Acne is nothing but bacteria and what can be more potent than honey and cinnamon for that problem? Honey and cinnamon bark have been known to have antibacterial properties and there's research to prove it.Green tea Anyone who knows anything about good health and modern day health elixirs swear by green tea as an antioxidant-packed drink that makes one look younger, lose weight and live a long and healthy life in various other ways. However, plant-based compounds and antioxidants can also do amazingly when applied directly on acne as they can reduce sebum production and fight inflammation to reduce production of acne on skin. While over-the-counter lotions and creams with green tea extract are widely available, its much simpler to make your own solution at home.Tea Tree oil You may have to venture a little further out of your kitchen for this one but we swear it is worth it. Tea tree oil is an over-the-counter essential oil that can be found at any local pharmacy. With anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties, this oil works like magic on fungal and bacterial infections as well as inflammations of all sorts. Extracted from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a tree endemic to Australia, Tea Tree Oil is less dry on the skin and less irritating than other remedies.When acne is there, fighting and getting rid of it can be as easy as stepping into your kitchen or the nearest pharmacy. But in order to really prevent these unsightly zits from even making an appearance, a healthy lifestyle is a must. We can also follow basic skincare rules such as not going to sleep with make up on and exfoliating and moisturising routinely.Make your own solution at homeAs adults and high functioning members of society, we may not realistically live entirely stress-free lives which is optimum for good, acne free, healthy skin, we can still try and help our skin by incorporating zinc and omega 3 fats into our diets and eating foods that have a low glycaemic load and less dairy content.A simple solution with one-part tea tree oil and 9 parts water, applied on the affected area will dry out the acne. For a clingier zit, apply twice a day.Boil green tea for a good 3 to 4 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool. Then pour it into a spray bottle and spritz it on your face as many times as required. Wash once your face has completely dried. The residue of the leaves need not go to waste either. Simply add it to a base of honey and use it as a face mask.Simply mix one-part vinegar to three (or more for sensitive skin) parts water and apply using a clean cotton ball. Let it dry for 20 seconds before washing off with cool water. Repeat this process up to two times in the day. It is important to note that because apple cider vinegar may cause some irritation, it is important to use it in small quantities and dilute it with adequate amounts of water.To make this rich paste, mix two tablespoons of honey to one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. Wash your face and apply the mask. Leave the mask on for 10 to 15 minutes before washing it off. Be sure to pat the face dry as rubbing may irritate the acne.Photo: LS Archive/ Sazzad Ibne Sayed",life_living
"To put it simply, arthritis is a kind of inflammation and can happen at one or more joints of the body at the same time. The two main types of arthritis are osteoarthritis — that involves wear-and-tear damage to a joint's cartilage and rheumatoid arthritis — when the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough covering that encloses all the joint parts. Usually, any joint in the body can be affected by arthritis but it is most common in the knees, hips, and elbows.According to Dr Nazmee Kabir, Evercare Hospital Dhaka, bone loss usually starts at the age of 30 (especially in women) and the onset of arthritis is more likely to begin in the early 50s. She adds that women are more prone to getting arthritis, especially during or after menopause. This specifically happens since there is a myriad of complex hormonal changes ongoing in the body during that time.Are osteoporosis and arthritis the same? Dr Kabir aptly highlights the key difference between these familiar medical conditions. ""Osteoporosis and arthritis are actually two very different conditions,"" she began. A joint has cartilage that causes the smoothness, and acts as the shock absorber during any movement. When there is damage, especially continual, to this cartilage, arthritis starts to set in."" She added, ""However, osteoporosis occurs when the density of the bone decreases."" For women, there is a sharp decline in bone density, especially after menopause and this is what leads them to have osteoporosis. Interestingly, in severe cases, osteoporosis and arthritis can even take place simultaneously in a person's body but in different joints.                        Myriad causes of arthritis Obesity Arthritis most commonly affects the lower joints and the key reason it occurs is due to being overweight or obese. ""When we walk or stand, we put most of our weight on our spine, hips, legs, and knees, and as we gain weight, our limbs are not able to support our body as much,"" Dr Kabir explained. This causes cartilage damage, eventually leading to stiffness or swelling of the joints. Age and sex The risk of having arthritis naturally increases with age and it is more common in females (mostly due to menopause, pregnancy and general deficiency in calcium intake in this part of the subcontinent). During menopause, the muscles become more relaxed and weaker, and women tend to gain more weight at that time due to the various hormonal changes going on inside their body. Pregnancy and childbirth Even childbirth and pregnancy can lead to arthritis. During this time, a woman is bearing more than her usual body weight and it enhances the wear and tear of joint tissues.           Family history In some cases, arthritis may emerge from a genetic disposition as well, in case the patient's immediate family (parents/siblings) had suffered.   Previous trauma Having a history of trauma where the bone joint was hurt and did not heal in the right way (for example, a fracture that did not heal properly), can also lead to arthritis in the adjacent joints. Additionally, there are some auto-immune diseases, which may also lead to getting secondary arthritis. Symptoms — Pain Ranging between mild, moderate and severe, pain is the most common symptom that any arthritis patient is bound to experience. Stiffness Stiffness or locking of the joints is another general indication of arthritis. One may be unable to feel or move their joints, especially after a long period of inactivity. Sometimes, one may even wake up in the morning and find their fingers or toes feeling stiff. In severe cases, there may even be deformities of the joints.           Swelling and redness Often, the damage in the cartilage that causes friction in the joints lead to some swelling and redness that is externally visible to the arthritis patient. Difficulty in walking When you are already weak in the knees, walking is not an easy task. Limping is quite normal for people suffering from arthritis in their hips or knees. Crepitus Dr Kabir defines crepitus as ""the cracking sound or feeling in the joints"" and it is very common to feel this during arthritis. Seeking specialist help — Dr Kabir advises to seek specialist guidance right from the first phase of pain. ""Once you consult a specialist in the initial stage, it becomes easier for the specialist to identify why the pain is happening, the type of arthritis and which stage you are in so that they can guide you properly,"" she elaborated. The treatment for each stage is different, so an early diagnosis is always helpful to find the right way to begin the treatment process. A multidisciplinary approach is the best kind of method to start off arthritis treatment and highly recommended by Dr Kabir. In a multidisciplinary approach, while a specialist will diagnose the cause and stage of the arthritis, a physiotherapist will show the exercise routine required and simultaneously, a dietician will guide the patient regarding nutrition and diet.           Medication or physiotherapy Medications, according to Dr Kabir, are only for symptom relief in case of arthritis. It is deemed a temporary relief for the pain, while in some cases, they work somewhat to improve the joint tissue but there is not enough evidence on this yet. For severe cases, injections, steroids, and anesthesia are also applied. ""Physiotherapy, on the other hand, can give you realistic and longer term relief from the pain and helps to make the muscle around your joints stronger,"" Dr Kabir revealed. The joint space is reduced in arthritis and physio helps to give traction to the feet and increase that crammed up space so it is much more relieving than medication. In fact, as per Dr Kabir, physio has evidently helped to significantly improve the condition of patients suffering from knee arthritis. In very severe cases, a total knee/joint/hip replacement surgery may be required by the patient. ""This kind of surgery has become more prevalent within the country in the last decade,"" Dr Kabir assured. These severe case patients usually face serious difficulty in walking or even just standing up as they have hardly any joint space left, the bones are locked in together and their only ray of hope at that point is a prosthesis placement through surgery. While this surgery is usually undertaken by elderly patients and it may involve few age-related risks and complications, it is a surgery lasting 2-3 hours and post-surgery care includes regular physiotherapy and rehabilitation for a month or two. The lifetime of the prosthesis is about 15 to 20 years and these patients usually do not face any problems in the long run and in rare cases, they might need a revision surgery. Healing and caring — Analgesics Dr Kabir elucidated that the general advice to fight pain is to take analgesics like paracetamol at home. ""Anything more powerful than that would surely require specialist advice,"" she mentioned. Warm compressions That hot water bag you stowed away in a drawer somewhere might just be your best friend when experiencing joint pains. Warm compressions really help to relieve the pain, swelling and redness. Joint-specific exercise Exercising on your specific joints, can help to make the muscles around your bones stronger and prevent from arthritis condition getting more aggravated. Weight reduction Maintaining a normal body weight (as per your own BMI) can help to keep arthritis at bay. Active lifestyle and healthy food According to Dr Kabir, just regularly staying active overall and having a healthy diet that is especially rich in calcium, vitamins and minerals can definitely help fight arthritis and keep it in check even if you start experiencing it. Although the process of arthritis causes cartilage damage that is almost irreparable, the pain might tend to peak like a sinus curve, decrease gradually and become episodic, and in some cases, it might even go away completely. The most crucial part of healing from arthritis is acceptance. Arthritis is one of the most common age-related ailments that in all honesty, it is irreversible and has no exact preventions. But what we do know is how to heal and care for ourselves when we experience it. That is why, the first step is to be alert when the first pain hits, and start with a multidisciplinary approach with regular checkups, to step into a life where we can learn to live with arthritis while having it under full control.

But what we do know is how to heal and care for ourselves when we experience it. That is why, the first step is to be alert when the first pain hits, and start with a multidisciplinary approach with regular checkups, to step into a life where we can learn to live with arthritis while having it under full control.

"In contrast to the myths that foster the misconception that menopause is a tumultuous time, if embraced and dealt with in the right manner, it can certainly be a positive time of life too. Although menopause can cause some noticeable and uncomfortable changes, these can be effectively managed too. After all, this is nothing but a normal process of aging and no woman is the first one going through it all alone.Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ""A woman is like a teabag; you can't tell how strong she is unless you put her into hot water."" Just like this quote goes, from bleeding every month to giving birth to new life — a woman goes through it all in her lifetime. And in all these phases of her life as she grows and ages, her body evolves dramatically too.The menarche, or the very first period cycle of an average woman's life tends to take place between the age of 10 and 16. Henceforth as she grows older, she continues to have her regular periods on a monthly basis. However, between her early 40s and 50, she usually goes through three critical stages of biological changes in her life, each of which affects her physical and mental health significantly. This cluster of changes is known as climacteric, (commonly known as menopause) which occurs over a period of time in three phases and it is the period when a woman experiences decline in her fertility and sexual activity.Dr Syeda Husna Akhter, Senior Consultant, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Bangladesh Medical College and Hospital, highlighted each phase in detail.""A woman goes through a plethora of hormonal and metabolic changes in her lifetime; in fact, the last one-third of a woman's life is spent almost completely without any ovarian functions,"" she explained.Dr Akhter added that this timeline specifically, is a very critical one in every woman's life as this is when she tends to become the most self-conscious and needs the most amount of physical and mental care from the people around her.Menopause in Stages and Symptoms PerimenopauseThe first phase, known as perimenopause or menopausal transition, begins as early as few years (late 30s or 40s) before the actual menopausal period. This is the stage when a woman's ovaries start to gradually produce lesser and lesser estrogen — the key hormone that aids a woman's reproductive and sexual developments. Usually, this phase may last 3-4 years and ends when a woman has gone about a year without having regular periods.One of the most common symptoms of perimenopause is hot flashes; this gives the incumbent a sudden feeling of heat, causing sweating and redness of the skin and face. Sometimes, it happens at night and are known as ""night sweats"" and may even leave you with rapid heart rate and chills as well.Dr Akhter further added that while hot flashes are a key symptom, other symptoms include scanty or delayed periods, fatigue, vaginal dryness, irritability and mood swings.MenopauseIn this stage, a woman proceeds from a reproductive to a non-reproductive stage in her life where she can no longer get pregnant naturally.""At this point, she has been through months (almost a year) without having periods and she is going through a serious physical and emotional change simultaneously,"" Dr Akhter pointed out.Similar to perimenopause, hot flashes continue to occur during menopause as well. Indigestion, following by bloating and/or constipation are also common symptoms according to Dr Akhter. Adding to that, an average woman may also experience a variety of indications relating to mental health and some common symptoms include depression, lethargy, irritability vertigo, headache, insomnia, anxiety, mood swings and even forgetfulness.Post menopauseThis occurs in the period after a woman has not bled for an entire year or longer, and is basically the rest of her life after going through menopause. Hot flashes are usually quite reduced in this phase.  However, according to Dr Akhter, post-menopausal health is equally important and it is crucial to look out for any peculiar or severe symptoms or after-effects.For certain women, developing osteoporosis — health issues relating to the bones and muscles — is quite common. The symptoms of osteoporosis include backache, fractures on minimal trauma, decreased height, and mobility. Moreover, after menopause, women may also become prone to having cardiovascular diseases as they experience hypertension and generally fat deposition also increases in this stage. In fact, in some cases relating to mental health, depression also heightens in an alarming manner.Dr Akhter further discussed more serious cases when due to the mucus linings thinning out and drying up (dry vagina), atrophic changes occur along the female genitalia when the elastic tissues start to get replaced by fibrous ones. This may lead to painful consequences such as vaginal bleedings, irritation, inflammation, and even urinary tract infections (UTIs) and urinary incontinence. Finding relief in distressEven though so much happens while a woman is going through her menopausal transition, there are of course several ways in which she can make her journey easier.On this note, Dr Akhter strongly recommended that mental support and comfort is the most important remedy and reassurance for every woman going through these phases.""It is the duty of her family, friends and loved ones around her to make her feel safe, loved and protected in this time of turmoil when she might be feeling the most vulnerable,"" she stated.Being a part of support groups/communities where she can speak with others going through similar journeys can also make her feel a like she's in a safe space.Having a balanced diet, filled with fresh fruits, vegetables, vitamin supplements, and the appropriate amount of fluids/water is another core component of coping with menopause. Especially, to prevent the occurrence of osteoporosis, Dr Akhter advises to increase the intake of calcium and Vitamin D-rich food, go for early morning sunbathing, and form an active lifestyle.In fact, regular exercise, yoga, meditation and walking — an overall active lifestyle also helps significantly to reduce the downsides of menopausal stages. In some cases, specialist help may be sought for artificial treatments. Usually the specialist will tend to prescribe few hormone tests, and after successful results they may move on to prescribing estrogen supplements coupled with calcium; this is a kind of a short-term hormone replacement therapy and helps the body to produce estrogen artificially.However, Dr Akhter cautions that in case the patient has any previous history of breast cancer, jaundice, etc. then aggressive estrogen therapy may lead to undesirable and severe health conditions such as cancer.As life goes on  After all that has happened, it is crucial to remember that menopause is a very natural biological process of life and every woman has to go through it when it is time.""Just like menarche happens in its time, so does menopause,"" said Dr Akhter comfortingly. The focus should lie primarily on how to live on normally after menopause has occurred.

"The nature trails of Bangladesh have a lot to offer, be it to flora and fauna enthusiasts or those looking for a spiritual experience. The roar of cascading waterfalls after monsoons, and the chirping of rare and exotic birds in unadulterated terrain, have a way of calling back those who have had a taste of trekking.For Saim Bin Mujib, a journalist and seasoned trekker, treks have always been a mode of self-discovery. ""Trekking always reminds me of what I am capable of. It tests my limits and demands my body to pull through, even when I think there is no option but to surrender. Whether it is the white-outs of foreign mountains, or hours of exhaustion and dehydration beyond what my body can bear locally, the hurdles help me get in tune with myself,"" explained Saim.Although testing your limits may be a life-changing experience, in your first few treks, it is best to be cautious and prepared. Here are some things to keep in mind, according to Saim, during the first few times you venture out.Places to pin Hills, slopes, and mountains can be a bit more challenging but the rewarding views near waterfalls and peaks usually make it worth it. If you want to experience the distinct serenity waterfalls induce with their majestic appearance and white noise, you should keep Hum Hum waterfall, Khoiyachora waterfall and Nafa-khum waterfall on your list. Although waterfalls are the liveliest during the peak of monsoon, it may be risky for newbies to trek then, as the soil may be extra slippery. ""September and October may be the best time to visit as the waterfalls still retain their beauty near the end of monsoon, without the trails being too difficult to navigate,"" advised Saim.          Photo: Saim Bin Mujib If you would rather trek through plains and flat lands, Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Lawachara National Park and St Martin's 360° are good options. Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawachara National Park are the perfect fix for those who are curious about the evergreen and deciduous forest biomes of Bangladesh. Both nature reserves house a wealth of plant, bird, primate, and reptile species, many of which are rare and endangered. Dressing the part Although there is usually no worry regarding weather extremities in Bangladesh, it is best to stay prepared. During winter, full length pants and windbreaker jackets are ideal as the weather tends to get pretty cold in the high altitudes during the morning and evening. Windbreakers are light but protective so they are the best for trekking. ""The sunlight can still get scorching by noon, so you may find yourself taking off your windbreaker anyways,"" remarked Saim. For summer, a breathable t-shirt, and some half or three-quarter pants can usually get the job done. Although sneakers are good for winter, they may feel too suffocating during summer months. Sandals with a good grip and a supportive back strap are the better option during warmer months. If there is a chance of rain, carry a raincoat. Your backpack should be one that is specialised for travel. The extra straps help evenly distribute the weight of the bag, while also supporting your balance.          Photo: Saim Bin Mujib Packing the necessities It is often hard to strike a balance between packing everything you need and ensuring your backpack stays light. Regardless, there are some items you must always have within easy reach. Make sure you have an emergency kit with all the medicine and supplies you may need. ""The first aid box for trekking has some of the more regular items, such as pain killers, band aid, and antacid. Then there are the extras, which you need to make sure you are healthy and hydrated throughout your hike. This includes electrolyte solutions and glucose. Dehydration is a common ailment during hikes,'' warned Saim. If you plan to stay the night, make sure to carry a headlamp or torch as you may need to leave your tent or accommodation when it is pitch black outside. For winters, carry a sleeping bag and extra layers of clothing in case it gets too cold. Guides help When visiting Bandarban, make sure you take a guide. Not only will they help make sure you are on track wherever you go, some can help make your overall experience much easier by helping with things like cooking. Trekking poles will be your second guide, so make sure to take one as well. Trekking poles make crossing slippery soil a lot easier and will also help you navigate shallow water bodies and streams.

"Australia on Wednesday reopened borders to vaccinated skilled migrants and foreign students after a near two-year ban on their entry, in a bid to boost an economy hit by stop-start Covid-19 lockdowns and restart international travel.The emergence of the new Omicron variant forced officials to delay the reopening by two weeks after health officials sought a temporary pause to get more information about the strain, which so far appears to show milder symptoms than other Covid-19 variants.""We're going to live with this virus, and we're not going to let it drag us back to where we've been,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told radio station 4BC on Wednesday. ""We've got one of the highest vaccination rates, which means we can fight this thing. We don't have to surrender to it.""Australia has inoculated nearly 90% of its population above 16 with two doses and shortened the wait time for booster shots after the emergence of the Omicron cases.Morrison, who had been deemed a casual contact after attending an event last week along with a Covid-infected person, said he has been cleared to fly interstate to Queensland after negative test results.""That's what living with the virus is,"" he said.Australia closed its borders in March 2020 in a bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus and had limited the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed entry. The relaxation of border rules is expected to ease labour shortages, which threaten to hamper an economic rebound.The return of foreign students, who are worth about A$35 billion ($25 billion) a year to the Australian economy, will help businesses to fill many casual jobs. More than 235,000 foreigners, including about 160,000 students, held visas for Australia at the end of October, official data showed.The easing in travel rules comes as the state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, lifted most restrictions from Wednesday for the unvaccinated, despite a steady rise in Omicron infections after a staggered reopening.The state logged 1,360 new cases, the biggest daily rise in more than three months and since a nearly four-month lockdown ended in early October.

"When it comes to business ownership, women just need fair and equal access—something easier said than done. Centuries of common practices and processes have created fundamental gender-based access disparities. Financial marginalisation and limited property rights are also significant impediments to women business owners. These limit potential buyers and business partners from ever seeing innovative solutions that women-owned businesses have created in engineering, automobile parts, logistics or AI, for example. Add conscious and unconscious bias to the mix and it is often an uphill battle requiring specific focus to overcome the hurdles.To better understand the obstacles that women business owners face across South Asia, the US Department of State's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs helped fund research on their status in corporate value chains and why so few of them win procurement contracts from corporate buyers. WEConnect International, a global non-profit that helps women-owned businesses compete in the global marketplace through capacity development and connections to large buyers, conducted the research as part of its ""Women's Empowerment through Economic Inclusion"" project, where 399 women-owned businesses and 199 large corporate buyers were surveyed.Some key regional takeaways from the women-owned businesses surfaced. These are: women-owned businesses are unable to effectively articulate their unique selling propositions and differentiate themselves from competitors; the lack of access by women to business networks, due to socio-cultural barriers, continues to keep men's and women's affairs separate; and women are at a disadvantage when accessing the full range of debt and equity alternatives required to set up and grow a business.In Bangladesh, lack of capital remains the most challenging issue with 90 percent of women business owners identifying it as the biggest impediment to running their businesses, while 48 percent indicated that a lack of connections to procurement and corporate buyers is a significant challenge.From the end of the buyers, a few crucial issues came up that need to be dealt with. For starters, the majority of corporate buyers did not have policies or practices in place to source from women-owned businesses. Although many buyers indicated product/service quality to be a key determinant in the selection of suppliers, they could not effectively pinpoint if women-owned businesses were lacking in this area. The disconnect between the business language of the buyers and women-owned businesses is also a concern. On top of that, buyers are tied to corporate credit policies that are often at odds with the needs of women-owned businesses, which are smaller and unable to withstand the pressures of longer-term credit recovery. Finally, there is a poor understanding among buyers on Gender Inclusive Sourcing practices.In Bangladesh, with respect to sourcing from women-owned businesses, 52 percent of buyers said they do not, 29 percent said they do, while 19 percent said they do not know. In addition, the majority of the respondents said they did not know how to find women-owned businesses.This is a problem with a solution: Gender-inclusive sourcing is a proactive supplier diversity strategy that addresses gender gaps in value chains to increase access to markets for women-owned businesses. The research indicates that there is appetite for change.The majority of buyers believe there is high potential to create market linkages, and 86 percent of corporate buyers are willing to buy from women-owned businesses when quality standards are met. Research suggests that there is a demand and supply match across many product and service categories in all countries. On average, 82 percent of corporate buyers are willing to learn about Gender Inclusive Sourcing practices and implement them in their organisations, and there is significant potential for women-owned businesses to become tier two and tier three suppliers to corporations.As beneficial as it is to the business owners themselves, and the communities in which they operate, investing in women-owned businesses also makes dollars and sense for large organisational buyers. Small changes to large organisational buying practices such as inclusive sourcing policies can have a significant impact on the business and its ability to find the best products and services at the best price, especially from women-owned businesses.Now is the time for Bangladesh to focus on empowering women and achieving gender equality. As the world slowly begins to adjust to a pandemic-stricken environment, harnessing the power of the entire business community to accelerate recovery and create opportunities for its citizens becomes the smartest strategy of all.

"The tax difference between listed and non-listed companies should be rationalised in order to encourage good companies and pursue well-performing large corporates for listing in the capital market, said Rizwan Rahman, president of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).Rahman made the comment while making a courtesy call on Prof Shibli Rubayat-Ul-Islam, chairman of Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, at the BSEC headquarters in Dhaka's Agargaon today.Citing the report of the Global Infrastructure Hub, the DCCI president said Bangladesh will need to invest $608 billion from 2016-2040 in the infrastructure sector.""The current trend indicates that Bangladesh will be able to meet $417 billion investments in the infrastructure sector leaving a financing gap of $192 billion from 2016-2040.

"The non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) can now show their unrealised interest of loans as income if borrowers can pay 25 per cent of their annual instalments by this year.The NBFI has taken the opportunity after the central bank had allowed banks to enjoy the same facility last week.The banking regulator today issued a notice in this regard saying that the loans will not be treated as default ones as well.The NBFIs will have to realise the instalment amounts by this year in order to enjoy the facility.Some central bank officials, however, opposed the measure saying that it would inflate the profit of the NBFI sector artificially as the income have not been earned in the form of cash.The profit of banks and NBFIs will just increase on papers, they said, differing the decision taken by the central bank's high-ups.The BB, however, said NBFIs would have to keep an additional 2 per cent provision against the loans, which will enjoy the opportunity.The non-banks will not be allowed to transfer the provisions to their income segment without prior approval from the central bank.The loans, which had been earlier rescheduled or restructured by taking special permission from the central bank, will not enjoy the relaxed policy.",business

"Chittagong port handled 31.15 lakh twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers so far this year, the highest since it began dealing with containers in 1977, as the economy of Bangladesh is returning to normalcy at a faster clip. The premier seaport of the country handled these import, export and empty containers as of yesterday, according to data from the traffic department of the Chittagong Port Authority (CPA).The CPA prepares the data by calculating the number of containers loaded and unloaded at the main jetties of the port, the Pangaon Inland Container Terminal in Keraniganj, and the Kamalapur Inland Container Depot (ICD) in Dhaka.""This is a very good sign. We hope export and import will continue to grow,"" said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), which represents the readymade garment industry that brings 84 per cent of the country's $38.7 billion export earnings.Annual container handling by the port crossed 30 lakh TEUs for the first time in 2019. The growth in the container handling was in the negative last year because of the drop in foreign trade due to the impact of the pandemic.Due to the decrease in the volume of container handling, the port slipped nine notches to 67th in the latest ranking of Lloyd's List's One Hundred Container Ports.Port officials now say the figure may reach 32 lakh TEUs by the end of 2021.Speaking about the record container handling, Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industries Vice President Syed Md Tanvir said, ""It definitely indicates that the country's economy is moving towards the pre-pandemic period. We have already recovered from the hit of the pandemic and we will go further.""""The growth potential is there. We expect that the port will also be ready to handle the growth,"" said Tanvir, also the managing director of Pacific Jeans, a denim exporter.Business leaders say container movement through the port is experiencing higher growth because of the sharp rise in imports and exports. With the reopening of factories following the second wave of Covid-19 since April this year, industrial production has increased.The import of industrial raw materials, especially for the garment sector, has gone up to meet the increased industrial production. Finished goods exports also rose.Syed Nazrul Islam, first vice-president of the BGMEA, appreciated CPA's efficient management for keeping the port operations uninterrupted during countrywide lockdown, helping accelerate import-export activities and sending container handling to a record high.CPA Chairman Rear Admiral M Shahjahan thanked all stakeholders for their contribution that allowed the port to achieve the record container throughput.He says the port authority has closely monitored the activities of private ICDs and took steps, including giving encouragement to the shipping lines for common carrier agreement, to avoid congestion.He said the port was continuously enhancing yard spaces to increase container storage capacity and started a process to purchase 104 types of equipment.A major portion of imported goods are now directly delivered from the port yards after unstuffing from containers, while only 38 types of inbound goods are sent to the private ICDs for delivery, Shahjahan said.If all types of import-laden containers are sent out of the port for delivery, the port, amid its current capacity, would be able to handle up to 4 million TEUs of containers annually.Once the under construction Patenga Container Terminal starts operation, the port would be capable to handle an additional 0.5 million TEUs containers per year.

"Malek Spinning has decided to shut the RMG unit of its subsidiary Salek Textile Mills due to continuous losses and low demand for its products.The board of Malek Spinning approved the closure of the readymade garment unit with effect from December 31, 2021 due to accumulated losses and expiry of the lease agreement of the factory building and premises, said the company in a regulatory filing posted on the website of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) yesterday.Malek Spinning holds 97.925 per cent stake in Salek Textile.The RMG unit has a capacity of producing 66 lakh pieces of garment items per annum, according to the company's annual report.The unit produces some special types of denim garments that have gone out of fashion in the international market, said Syed Saiful Haque, company secretary of Malek Spinning.So, it incurred losses in the last two financial years. The loss stood at Tk 12 crore in 2019-20 and Tk 2 crore in 2020-21.The liabilities of the unit will be settled by selling the assets of the unit such as factory plant and machinery, and borrowing from Salek Textile.Malek Spinning will not have to bear any cost related to the settling of the liabilities, said the disclosure. Malek Spinning shares closed 3.19 per cent lower at Tk 27.30 on the DSE yesterday.The textile sector in general, and the RMG sector in particular, had faced various internal and external difficulties, said AFM Zubair, chairman of Malek Spinning, in the annual report for 2020-21.Enhanced and costly compliance standards from customers, new regulations in regard to building and fire safety, high wage rate as fixed by the government, and the price hike of power and gas had had direct negative impact on the cost of production and the price of products and export revenues, making survival difficult, he said.Despite the adverse effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, Malek Spinning had succeeded in clocking higher net profit thanks to an increase in turnover in 2020-2021.Sales rose 53 per cent year-on-year to Tk 1,503 crore in the last financial year, while profits surged to Tk 65 crore reversing from a Tk 33 crore loss in the previous year, according to the annual report.

"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday advised the government not to extend general forbearance to banks and corporations.The Washington-based multilateral lender also called for phasing out the interest rate caps on lending and deposits.It sounded the alarm about Bangladesh's ongoing economic recovery given the rapid spread of the latest variant of Covid-19, saying that it may have an adverse impact on the rebound.The IMF also suggested the government widen its tax to GDP ratio, ensure exchange rate flexibility and strengthen the business-friendly environment to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).An IMF team offered these recommendations during a press briefing at the InterContinental Dhaka after completing several meetings with different government entities and representatives of businesses, banks and labour unions.Rahul Anand, division chief of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, led the team, which visited Bangladesh between December 5 and December 19 under the multilateral lender's Article IV consultation.The IMF yesterday raised its projection on the country's economic growth for fiscal 2021-22 from 6.5 per cent to 6.6 per cent. However, the projection is still lower than the government's target of 7.2 per cent.The GDP growth is expected to pick up further to hit 7.1 per cent in FY2022-23, the IMF said.Explaining the slight rise in this year's growth forecast for Bangladesh, Anand said the country's export sector was doing well.""We have seen lots of export orders being diverted from Vietnam, Myanmar, China and India to Bangladesh, and that is helping the country increase its export earnings,"" he said.In addition, business activities, including that of the garments sector, have picked up, prompting the IMF to raise its projection.""But, there are uncertainties around this because we still have half a year till the fiscal year ends.The most important thing now is understanding how Covid-19 impacts the countries that are trading partners of Bangladesh,"" Anand said.""Containment measures taken by those countries may have a big impact on the export earnings of Bangladesh and so, anything can go wrong,"" he added.There will be domestic risks as well if Omicron causes a new round of infections. Besides, the price of oil and commodities has gone up in the global market, which may put pressure on the economy.Reflecting non-food price inflation, which rose a 62-month high in October, and the recent hike in fuel prices, inflation is projected to be slightly higher than the central bank's target.So, the central bank should keep a close watch on the inflationary pressure, said the IMF.The IMF division chief went on to say that providing general forbearing during the peak of the pandemic was appropriate to support businesses as it helped spur economic recovery.""Our advice is an orderly exit from all these relaxations that were given to the banks as well as corporations,"" he said.In addition, proper identification of problem assets in the banking sector, which are mostly concentrated in the state-owned lenders, is highly important.Bangladesh needs lots of investment but the high rate of non-performing loans has increased the cost of lending and hindered the smooth disbursal of funds.In terms of corporate governance and other reforms, the authorities are now giving effort to amend five relevant laws, including the Banking Companies Act.The IMF's advice aims to help align the best international practices while amending the five acts, according to Anand.""This will strengthen the financial sector, which will play a major role in upgrading the country to middle-and-higher income status.""Meanwhile, interest rate caps on lending and deposit limit the policy space so they should be phased out to strengthen market-based pricing and improve credit allocation and monetary transmission.Greater exchange rate flexibility together with safeguarding foreign exchange reserves will help buffer external shocks as well.He also touched upon Bangladesh's tax to GDP ratio, which is one the lowest in the world.""We have been discussing the issue with relevant authorities, who are very keen to fix the problem to raise revenue,"" Anand said.As Bangladesh grows and becomes more integrated with the rest of the world, investors compare the country with other nations before making any investment.So, Bangladesh should give emphasis attracting FDI as it is highly important in the context of gaining technology and integrating with the global value chain, said the IMF.The country is now considered a success story as it made substantial progress in the last 50 years.Bangladesh was once one of the poorest nations in the world but has since graduated from the situation, Anand said.""This is a great achievement for the country, which is now fulfilling a good number of the Sustainable Development Goals.""However, a major portion of Bangladesh's export earnings still comes from garments and so, it is time to diversify the export basket, he added.

"With many export-oriented firms facing losses for cancellation of export orders by buyers or other factors and sit with stock of raw materials, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has relaxed rules regarding holding period of raw materials imported duty-free by firms under bonded warehouse licence.Additional time will be granted for export-oriented factories with bonded warehouse licence if the quality of raw materials remain good and the firms' get buyers abroad.The decision is welcomed by the exporters as it facilitates exports and cuts the exporters' risk of increased liabilities.""It is a good decision,"" said Faruque Hassan, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the country's one of the largest trade associations representing readymade garment industry, which accounts for nearly 84 per cent of annual exports of $38.7 billion.He said exporters bring in raw materials in order to make finished products for shipping. On many occasions, buyers cancel orders, go bankrupt.Under such circumstances, raw materials imported to make exportable products become liabilities for exporters and they have to sell the items in the local market after paying duty and taxes to the NBR.There is no benefit if the products are not made and exported, he said.Hassan, also managing director of Giant Textiles Ltd, said the NBR's latest decision will be instrumental to increase exports.In general, the NBR grants a 24-month time to the export-oriented factories to hold raw materials to make products and exports.The permission to retain raw materials for additional six months comes from the Customs Bond Commissionerates (CBCs)—one in Dhaka and another in Chattogram—and from the NBR, said an official of the tax administrator.In its latest order issued last week, the NBR said it will consider granting additional bonding period for raw materials if the exporters apply.Export-oriented firms in the export processing zones, economic zones and hi-tech parks will also get scope to apply for time extension if bonding period expires.The NBR will consider the applications case to case basis, according to the notification.""We have done it to facilitate exports,"" said the NBR official.Md Saiful Islam, president elect of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, termed the NBR decision timely.""The latest decision will not affect revenue.

However, the central bank ordered them to disregard BSEC's orders.The dispute arose when, after a meeting with Bangladesh Bank, the BSEC said the central bank would change its bank exposure policy by allowing cost-based exposure instead of market value.However, the central bank refuted this, saying no such decision was not taken at the meeting.In such a situation, the fight took a new turn as the BSEC curtailed banks' power to cancel payments to perpetual bond holders.In protest, Bangladesh Bank a sent letter to lenders in the country, saying the BSEC's condition is at odds with central bank guidelines on risk-based capital adequacy.Such a tussle between the two regulators is badly affecting the market, the merchant banker added.Eastern Insurance topped the gainers list yesterday, rising 10 per cent, followed by Asia Insurance, Bangladesh National Insurance, Khan Brothers PP Woven Bag, and Shurwid Industries.Stocks of Beximco Ltd traded the most, worth Tk 73 crore, followed by One Bank, Sonali Paper, Fortune Shoes, and Active Fine Chemicals.SS Steel shed the most, dropping 8.84 per cent, followed by Aramit Cement, Fortune Shoes, Beach Hatchery, and Aziz Pipes.At the DSE, 87 stocks advanced, 266 fell and 25 remained same.The prime bourse suffered yet another setback as investors' mounted sell-offs in all major sectors, including banks and financial institutions, International Leasing Securities said in its daily market review.The DSEX plummeted 85 points as the current market scenario failed to offer any clear indication of recovery for investors.However, several small-caps from various sectors and the general insurance sector remain in the investors' good grace, it added.Among major sectors, based on market capitalization, financial institutions the dropped most followed by food and allied, and bank.Investor activity was mostly concentrated on the bank, general insurance and miscellaneous sectors.The Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) also fell yesterday as the CASPI, the main index of the port city bourse, dropped 336 points, or 1.67 per cent, to 19,738.Among 285 traded stocks, 63 rose, 204 fell and 18 remained unchanged.",business
"Real estate developers are concerned about the increasing cost of building materials as well as the proposed Detailed Area Plan (DAP), which will guide future constructions in Dhaka city, according to the Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB).""I fear the price of flats will go up in the future if the cost of construction materials, especially rod and cement, continues to rise and the proposed DAP is implemented,"" said Alamgir Shamsul Al-Amin, president of REHAB.As such, a basic human need such as housing could go beyond the reach of middle-class people if these issues are not addressed.Al-Amin made these comments while discussing the upcoming REHAB Fair during a press conference at Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka yesterday.""So, this year's fair could be a golden opportunity for buyers as various companies will be offering relatively special prices for flats from previously initiated projects,"" he said.Besides, if the housing sector moves forward, so too will backward linkage industries such as cement, paint, steel and ceramics, Al-Amin added.In light of the new DAP being prepared by Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha for the 2017-35 period, the Dhaka Building Construction Rules 2021 are also being framed.If these rules are finalised, the size of buildings approved for construction will shrink by at least 33 per cent to 53 per cent compared to current standards while the price of flats will increase 50 per cent.Opposing the proposed guidelines, REHAB wrote a letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina detailing these issues in the first week of December.The REHAB Fair 2021, a five-day event where members of the REHAB will showcase their housing solutions, is set to begin on December 23 after a two-year hiatus.The fair, to be held at the Bangabandhu International Conference Center in Agargaon, will feature 220 stalls with building material suppliers and financial institutions also taking part.Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi is scheduled to participate in the inaugural ceremony as chief guest.Like every year, visitors who attend the fair will have the chance to win attractive prizes from a raffle draw with their entry tickets. REHAB first started hosting the fair back in 2001 and has since handed over more than 2.25 lakh apartments from the annual event.With a current membership of 1,191 companies, REHAB is the only trade organisation of real estate developers in the country.",business
"Debt problems at a major Chinese property developer have now spilled over into a vital artery of the nation's industrial engine - the steel sector - and started to ripple through to other critical parts of the world's second-largest economy.The spreading balance-sheet crisis at real estate firms is a warning for policymakers as a swing in the fortunes of the steel industry would have significant repercussions for China's economy, with cement, glass, and household appliances all vulnerable to demand drops.Already, steel prices are down from their record highs seen earlier this year due to easing demand from construction activities, which account for over half of the metal's consumption, while steelmakers' share prices have also been hurt.Steel's acute sensitivity to the ebbs and flows in construction and manufacturing makes it a closely-tracked bellwether for China's economy, which has started to slow down from the second quarter. Steel firms are also massive employers that support a vast supply chain.Hitting steel operations, real estate developers have dialled back investment in projects to conserve cash in a sector squeezed by tighter borrowing regulations that have engulfed indebted companies, most notably China Evergrande Group.""We normally stockpile steel products in winter at relatively lower prices and sell them after the new year holidays when consumption resumes. But we are holding off this year,"" said Qi Xiaoliang, a Beijing-based steel trader.""There's still uncertainty in the real estate market for 2022 and the situation is not expected to be fully reversed for another six to 12 months,"" he added.In the final quarter of 2021, the property market took a further hit as the unease in the sector shook already weak buyer sentiment, with unsold housing stock in China's 100 biggest cities reaching a five-year high in November.Demand for homes is expected to ease further in 2022, hitting downstream manufacturers of household products.Cement production, another construction material, was down around 16 per cent for September-November year-on-year, and was lower versus the same period between 2017 and 2019. Demand for earth excavators has also dropped off in recent months.The broadening spillover impact of the property downturn was also seen elsewhere. In the appliances industry, for example, monthly refrigerator output has been falling since May through to November on an annual basis.Steel producers were among the best performers of the entire Chinese economy over the first three quarters of 2021, with China's 28 major listed mills pocketing over 106 billion yuan ($16.61 billion) in net profits, up 174 per cent year-on-year and 129 per cent higher than in pre-pandemic 2019.But the boom times in the steel sector are over. The paralysis that has struck China's mammoth construction industry is triggering a rare contraction in building activity across the country.New construction starts by floor area have contracted from a year earlier since July - their longest stretch of declines since 2015.The slowdown in the real estate sector has dented China's monthly crude steel output by more than 20 per cent since September.The closely-tracked steel equity instruments and commodities futures have captured the reversal of fortunes.After gaining roughly 90 per cent through mid-September, the CSI steel equities index has plunged 27 per cent since, while futures prices for construction materials rebar and wire rod have tumbled 24 per cent and 31 per cent respectively from their historical highs to erase almost all their gains this year.As steel producers hit the brakes, the key inputs used in steelmaking have also taken a shellacking, with Dalian Commodity Exchange iron ore futures down more than 45 per cent from their record in May.Gross profits for steel rebar have started to trend down from the peak seen in late September.Property-related sectors are the single biggest contributor to China's economy, accounting for 28 per cent of GDP in 2021, down from a recent peak of 35 per cent in 2016.The GDP share is broken down into a 7 per cent direct contribution from property and a 21 per cent indirect contribution from construction and through sectors along the supply chain such as machinery and equipment, according to Moody's.A government industry consultancy forecast China's steel demand will slip 0.7 per cent in 2022, following an expected 4.7 per cent decline this year.Looking ahead, any extended credit constraints ""could reduce demand for metals used in construction as developers lose the ability to pay for raw materials at high prices,"" analysts with Fitch Solutions wrote in a recent note to clients.If the contraction in construction spending endures, it will then affect the producers of appliances and white goods that constitute a key part of China's critical manufacturing base.""Property construction has been the engine of China's economy for over two decades now,"" said Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC.""With building activity likely to remain depressed for quite some time, growth will inevitably shift down a year or two.""",business
"US retailers opened their doors on Saturday to what they hope will be swarms of shoppers searching for last-minute holiday gifts, despite surging cases of the coronavirus, including the new, highly-contagious Omicron variant.The last Saturday before Christmas dubbed 'Super Saturday' is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year, marked by a rush to buy last-minutes gifts to tuck under the Christmas tree.The risks to shoppers this year, however, are not just that merchandise might be out of stock, but also that in-person shopping could trigger more coronavirus infections - making Super Saturday a super-spreader event.Toy store owner Katherine Nguyen says she anticipates more people to shop in person at her three Chicago-area locations compared to the last Saturday before Christmas 2020, or even the last Saturday before the pre-pandemic Christmas of 2019.""It's like the new variant is the new normal the environment has gotten a little used to that,"" she said. Foot-traffic tracking firm Placer.ai said it expects more people to visit stores this weekend than on the same weekend last year.Sensormatic Solutions, a data firm that measures store visits, cited a nearly 48 per cent increase in foot traffic on the Friday after Thanksgiving compared to a year earlier as a sign that people would want to shop in-person.A supply chain logjam has left many people also feeling nervous about not getting merchandise ordered online in time for the December 25 holiday.""Consumers have been bombarded with messages about the impact of supply shortages on the availability of holiday gifts,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.Nguyen said her three stores never received shipments of merchandise for about 15 per cent of their toy catalog.The toys, she says, are  ""sitting on a container in Long Beach, California, outside of the water waiting to come in."" FedEx and the US Postal Service set December 15 as the deadline for ground deliveries to reach homes in time for Christmas, which means that shoppers still in search of gifts may have little choice but to shop in stores if they want to avoid fees for expedited shipping.FedEx and rival United Parcel Service each say they have hired enough workers to manage the holiday peak, when the number of daily packages they handle easily doubles. Unlike last year, many consumers heeded advice from retailers to shop early - easing pressure on carriers by spreading demand over a longer period of time.But online shoppers may see more delays as Christmas approaches, according to Cathy Morrow Roberson, president of consultancy Logistics Trends & Insights.",business
"China's antimonopoly bureau will step up legal enforcement against monopolistic behaviour and push forward the amended antimonopoly law to improve the regulatory framework, said Gan Lin, chief of the national antimonopoly bureau.China last month elevated the seniority of the market regulator's antitrust unit, the National Anti-Monopoly Bureau, and appointed Gan as chief, a move which would help antitrust investigators gain resources when examining mergers and acquisitions.Gan said China still faces ""insufficient punishment"" for some monopolistic activities, while some antitrust regulations remain at the elementary level.""With the rapid development of the digital economy, and new industries and business models emerging one after another, there are great differences in competition modes between the new and the traditional economy,"" Gan said in an interview published on the official website of State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Sunday.""There's an urgent need to further improve the anti-monopoly legislation and industry regulation.""China shed its once relatively laissez-faire approach to market regulation of the internet sector in dramatic fashion this year, blocking mergers and imposing a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding for abusing its market position.Alibaba was found to have engaged in the practise of ""choosing one from two,"" in which an e-commerce platform bars vendors from selling on rival sites.Gan said this practice was not evident during China's annual ""618 shopping festival"" and Singles' Day online shopping festival this year after the bureau kicked off a sector-wide rectification.In October, it levied a $527 million fine on food delivery giant Meituan for abusing its dominance.""The orderliness of market competition has shown great improvement, and the smaller business operators have now gained broader space,"" Gan said.For the next step, the bureau will step up antimonopoly reviews of concentrated businesses, and will continue to prevent mergers from disrupting the market, and curb excessive capital expansion, Gan said.",business

"Alban Nikolai Herbst's Berlin apartment is covered in dust, his precious record collection included, thanks to a coal-powered stove he still uses to heat his home like thousands across the city.Germany's new government is set to extinguish the at-home heat source from a bygone era as part of its ambitious climate plans, as it looks to cut harmful emissions linked to climate change.But Herbst says he remains attached to his coal-powered stove, which he clings to for  ""sentimental"" reasons.Arriving in Berlin in the mid-1990s, Herbst discovered an odour that had long disappeared from the streets of western cities, where -- unlike in the ex-communist east -- domestic coal burning had died out.The  ""heavy heat"" emanating from his stove suits his work as a writer too. ""I am always at my desk. I work from six o'clock in the morning to 10 at night sometimes,"" he says.Hans Engelke Energie supplies much of the coal used in the ovens across Berlin, and estimates between 5,000 to 6,000 homes still rely on the retro heat source.The family-run business is one of the last in Berlin still delivering briquettes of black coal to customers.It has had to diversify over recent years to survive, and now delivers home heating oil and wood pellets.""We sell gas and electricity, too,"" says company co-head Peter Engelke, adding that the company  ""hopes to prosper for a long time"".Germany's new government, which took office this month, has made the battle against climate change a priority, announcing a target to phase out the use of coal by 2030.Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition has pledged to expand renewable energy and decrease reliance on sources such as Russian gas in the long run.Some Berlin residents have already made the shift at home.Graphic designer Robert Schumann, who lives in the east of the city, still uses his ceramic stove to heat his home, but has dropped the coal in favour of wood.""It's more ecological,"" he says, drawing a comparison with fossil fuels excavated from the earth.""Less ash, and it's a more sustainable energy source because trees grow back.""",business
"After a decade-long hiatus, Russia is relaunching an ambitious bid for dominion over the world's budding space tourism industry, jostling with zealous billionaires, the United States, and rising China.Russia flaunted its comeback this month dispatching two cosmic adventurers -- Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and his assistant -- to the International Space Station (ISS) in its first launch of tourists in 12 years.Buoyed by the success, firebrand space chief Dmitry Rogozin talked up Russia's next steps to supremacy: a special module at the ISS for Russia's visitors, spacewalks outside the station, and -- down the line -- trips around the moon. ""We will not give this niche to the Americans. We are ready to fight for it,"" he told reporters at a press conference as Maezawa was blasting towards the ISS on a 12-day mission.Yet Russia's path to industry dominance is dotted with new obstacles that have emerged since it was last in the game a decade ago.Back then, the Russian space agency Roscosmos had a monopoly on sending the cash-flushed curious to space. That changed when US agency NASA retired its own shuttle for astronauts in 2011 and snatched up every seat to the ISS Roscosmos had on offer for the next decade.Then, last year, billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX barged onto the scene with its first successful ISS mission and NASA dropped Roscosmos.At a reported $90 million per seat, this was a huge financial blow to the cash-strapped Russian space agency, hit simultaneously with budget cuts and corruption scandals.Analysts say Roscosmos has no choice but to turn to tourism to cover the shortfall. ""The Russian space industry is reliant on consistent orders for these launches,"" industry analyst Vitaly Yegorov told AFP.The price tag for one seat -- estimated at $50-60 million -- covers the cost of building the three-person Soyuz spacecraft to shuttle the crew, he said, while a second traveller turns a profit. But space tourism is not just about the money, officials say.""It's national prestige. It gets young people interested in manned spaceflight. It's the future, after all,"" says Dmitry Loskutov, head of Glavkosmos -- a subsidiary of Roscosmos responsible for commercial projects, including tourism.Russia, China and the United States are the only countries capable of manned flights, but a slew of newcomers are entering the scene and forcing Russia to step up its game, SpaceX among them.Musk has yet to take tourists to the ISS, but this year his Inspiration4 brought an all-civilian crew into Earth's orbit on a three-day mission.Also eager for a cut are Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin Galactic of billionaire Richard Branson. Both their spacecrafts completed maiden voyages this year, remaining several minutes in zero gravity before returning to Earth.But Andrei Ionin of the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics says you just can't compare the billionaires' brief, low-orbit flights to a days-long mission to the ISS. ""It's like comparing the Ferrari and the Renault market,"" he said.Loskutov echoed the point, saying the trips were more a part of the  ""entertainment industry"" than the space travel.Still, Yegorov said,  ""competition is heating up,"" particularly from SpaceX. Russia has taken note. It wants to expand offerings, including a spacewalk during an upcoming tourist mission, Loskutov said.Moscow has also unveiled plans for its own orbital station with the ISS set to retire in the next decade and Rogozin has said there could be a  ""separate tourist module"" on board.He raised the possibility of new routes, following, for example, the path of the first human in space Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.Rogozin has also said that after 2030 Roscosmos hoped to offer a trip around the moon.But that timeline falls far behind SpaceX ambitions -- it has announced a mission to take eight people around the moon as early as 2023.Another complication Roscosmos faces in the sector is assessing and meeting demand.For one, Soyuz spacecraft are expensive and a mission takes at least two years to organise.Loskutov said Russia has pre-ordered a rocket for the next launch and Rogozin instructed his agency to boost its Soyuz production.Real demand -- not just interest -- is hard to assess too.Candidates must be willing to shell out, meet health requirements and commit to months of training and a rehabilitation period after returning to Earth. ""In my opinion, there aren't a lot of people -- but you don't need many, anyway,"" Ionin said.At least for now, he said, Russia is ahead thanks to the Soviet-designed and time-tested Soyuz. ""For the next five to 10 years, there is no threat to the business of Roscosmos,"" Ionin added.",business

"Instagram currently has over 2 billion monthly active users, reports CNBC, citing an anonymous employee of the social media platform who reportedly leaked the information.This information still warrants confirmation, but likely will not be officially announced anytime soon, as neither Facebook nor Instagram, social media sites owned by Meta, are known for disclosing official information regarding yearly finance and active user count.The last time such information was publicly disclosed was back in June 2018, where Instagram was announced to have reached over 1 billion monthly active users.Experts suggest this is a key milestone for Instagram, especially considering the backlash the company has faced recently.On 8 December, Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, was called to Congress to testify for the app's security concerns, especially regarding content management for its younger users.During the testimony, Mosseri stated that he is proud of how Instagram has kept younger users safe. This statement contrasted the US lawmakers' notion that Instagram is harmful to teens and the company hasn't done enough to promote a healthy and safe platform.TikTok, Instagram's rival app, announced in September that it reached 1 billion monthly active users. While Instagram had a head start in user count, the competition is still going strong.A survey by the global research company Forrester states that in 2021, 57% of US citizens aged from 12 to 17 used Instagram on a weekly basis. To compare with Instagram's rival app, TikTok garnered 63% users in the same demographic. Statistics by Sensor Tower show that TikTok has also beaten Instagram in overall downloads this year in Apple and Google devices, reaching 596.1 million global installations versus Instagram's 570.7 million.",tech_news
"Nike joined the wave of brands buying into excitement over virtual goods Monday as the sportswear giant announced it has bought RTFKT, a company that makes digital sneakers. RTFKT -- pronounced 'artefact' -- sells digital items in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), virtual assets that are authenticated using the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies. ""This acquisition is another step that accelerates Nike's digital transformation and allows us to serve athletes and creators at the intersection of sport, creativity, gaming and culture,"" said Nike CEO John Donahoe.Nike said the terms of the acquisition would not be disclosed. But the purchase reflects growing interest from big brands in NFTs.In May, an NFT of a Gucci handbag sold online for more than the real version would cost. The clamour over virtual goods comes over feverish predictions that the 'metaverse' -- a virtual reality version of the internet -- will eventually replace the web of today. Retail is one sector that could be transformed, with shoppers perhaps eventually donning virtual reality goggles to examine 3D replicas of real clothes. Nike has already opened 'Nikeland', a virtual showroom on gaming platform Roblox, where visitors can dress their avatars in Nike clothes.Founded last year, RTFKT seized on a similarity between sneakers and NFTs: both are often coveted as collectable items. In March, RTFKT reportedly sold 600 pairs of physical sneakers for $3.1 million -- but the items promoted as having 'real' value were the NFT versions of the sneakers sold with each pair. ""We're excited to grow our brand which was fully formed in the metaverse,"" RTFKT co-founder Benoit Pagotto said in a statement released by Nike. NFTs have generated huge interest over the past year, with enthusiasts predicting they will become a widespread form of ownership.

The company is expected to launch the iPhone SE with 5G capabilities in early 2022, according to media reports and the brokerage, with the analysts adding the model will allow Apple to target the mid-range smartphone market dominated by rivals such as Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies.The upcoming smartphone has the potential to lure nearly 1.4 billion low- to mid-end Android phones and about 300 million older iPhone model users, the brokerage estimated.""Apple's trade-in program for non-iPhones is admittedly not as attractive as the iPhone trade-in values, it could nonetheless lead to an average starting price range of $269 to $399 for the 5G iPhone SE, which is still very competitive,"" analyst Samik Chatterjee, rated five stars on Refinitiv Eikon for his estimate accuracy, said.The iPhone SE currently starts from $399, compared with $799 for the iPhone 13 and $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro.Since launching the iPhone 13 range and new iPads in September, Apple has scrambled to keep up with the global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions.Meanwhile, Apple's shares have extended their march, with the company inching closer to the $3 trillion in market capitalization. On a separate note, J.P.Morgan said consumer demand for major upgrades like 5G models is expected to remain strong and also a priority for supply, even as it wanes for most hardware products including smartphones, TVs and PCs.The brokerage raised its estimates for fiscal 2022 iPhone SE unit sales to 30 million units and annual iPhone shipments expectations to 250 million units, 10 million higher than a year earlier.JPM raised its target price for Apple to a Street high of $210 from $180, according to Refinitiv Eikon.",tech_news
"Yesterday, Time Magazine announced the latest entry to their 'Person of the Year' recognition: the billionaire space entrepreneur and CEO at SpaceX and Tesla Inc., Elon Musk. According to Time, Elon Musk exemplarily represented the changing shifts in technology this year and helped people all over the globe with his innovative ideas. Musk -- who overtook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos this year to become the world's wealthiest person -- wields impact on Earth with his Tesla electric car company and beyond our planet with his SpaceX rockets.  ""Musk's rise coincides with broader trends of which he and his fellow technology magnates are part cause and part effect,"" Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote.Among those trends, Felsenthal listed ""the continuing decline of traditional institutions in favour of individuals; government dysfunction that has delivered more power and responsibility to business and chasms of wealth and opportunity. ""Time editors have previously defined the title -- which last year went to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris -- as going to people who ""embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse."" In October, Musk's electric car company's valuation soared above a trillion dollars, and SpaceX has teamed up with US space agency NASA to launch various missions including a test run of protecting Earth from an asteroid. The brash South African-born 50-year-old has seen his wealth soar during the pandemic to over $250 billion, according to Forbes' real-time billionaires list. He has also courted controversy with his provocative Twitter feed that can attack, joke and provoke -- including a poll in November asking Twitter whether he should sell a 10% share of his Tesla stock.Felsenthal noted Musk's provocative vision is accompanied by a persona that is a  ""blunt instrument that often seems to revel in division and aggressive mockery as he gives the world access to his id through social media."" Musk has appeared ever-present in American culture in recent years, amassing 66 million Twitter followers and guest-hosting the famed late-night comedy show Saturday Night Live in May. Musk speaks ambitiously about his interest in colonizing Mars and plans orbital flights next year as part of SpaceX's planned American return to the Moon. ""The goal overall has been to make life multi-planetary and enable humanity to become a spacefaring civilization,"" Musk told Time in an interview released with the Person of the Year announcement. ""SpaceX is starting a program to take CO2 out of the atmosphere; turn it into rocket fuel. Please join if interested,"" he tweeted later Monday, in an announcement that was as eye-catching as it was short of detail.Musk has also been known to move markets and the value of cryptocurrencies with a single tweet, but his main terrestrial influence, for now, is with his electric vehicles. ""Our intent with Tesla was always that we would serve as an example to the car industry, and hope that they also make electric cars so that we can accelerate the transition to sustainable energy,"" Musk told Time.Time notes that in an earlier era interplanetary travel was a collective undertaking that leaders used to rally their nations, but that increasingly private companies are involved. ""To Musk, that is progress, steering capital allocation away from the government to those who will be good stewards of it,"" Felsenthal wrote. ""To others, it is testament to capitalism's failings as staggeringly wealthy, mostly white men play by their own rules while much of society gets left behind,"" he added. ",tech_news
"The new Honda Civic for 2022 is out, welcoming the 11th generation on their lineup which could almost be taken for an Accord; from a certain distance and after squinting hard enough. The new Civic debuts new body styling, interior design and features both in terms of driver aid and infotainment. This week, we got our hands on one and we finally got to drive the car. Keep reading to find out what more the new Honda Civic has to offer.The new bits The new 11th gen Civic comes completely refreshed, with a new plaid design and interior bits and pieces where the Civic comes in four different packages sporting two different engine options; a 2L which comes in the base model and a 1.5L turbocharged made available for the higher trim levels. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.            Our test mule was an EX package with the 1.5L version which is, ironically the only version available (including the EX touring package, of course) in Bangladesh as the base model comes with a 2L, which also has less power compared to the turbo and due to our taxation system, which is solely based on engine capacity, the base model will end up costing more than the top of the line Civic available. A couple of other things to note is that the sedan version of the Civic does not offer a manual gearbox, it comes standard with a CVT; although if a manual transmission is absolutely necessary, there's the SI version available. Exterior; a new generation The exterior of the 11th gen Civic receives a dramatic design change which in retrospect, eliminates drama that was present in the last, introducing us to a new simpler, mature design language with easy to read straight body lines which end on the LED headlights with running DRLs, where the LEDs are a standard option through the whole lineup, even when it comes to the taillights.           Interior and infotainment Jump inside the Civic and you will find everything well laid out in the right positions and since the car is targeted towards heavy commuters in general, Honda did not overcomplicate the knobs and buttons which the driver or the passengers will interact with. Expect satisfactory materials used throughout the interior but since it's a Civic and not an Accord; do not expect Honda giving out genuine leather on the seats and wooden trim pieces. The seats in the Civic are roomy and although they are made of fabric, they come heated; and are manually operated, which is a bit of a bummer, but they still get the job well done. As far as the climate control goes, it's controlled with a bunch of knobs where the air comes through a honeycomb mesh sandwiched between the infotainment system screen and the AC controls, which gets cold enough to tackle Dhaka weathers.           What sets apart the Civic from the bigger Accord is the obvious cost-cutting done from Honda. For example, the Piano black Trim pieces on the front doors of our test car had a light bar going in the middle of the piece but the rear doors do not have it, but that is just me being nitpicky. The back seats though are amazing for a commuter. They are comfortable and have enough legroom where you can stretch your legs and your knees will not touch the front seat. There's also an armrest with cup holders in the middle which also adds up as an extra seat when folded up. Another feature which the new Civic has and I would like to see implemented in other cars as well as the feature to fold the seats directly from the boot of the car, which is a foolproof feature and contributes to extra convenience.           The infotainment system, on the other hand, has quite a lot to offer while maintaining simplicity; yet another effort from Honda not to overcomplicate what the user will interact with. It comes 7'' standard but it can be upgraded to a 9'' which usually comes in the LX package as standard. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also come standard which is always good to see. The sound is delivered through pairs of Bose speakers for the first time in a Civic, where the mids are well pronounced which makes the sound clear but it lacks a bit around the low end; the bass could be just a bit more satisfying but in the end, the mids make a satisfactory cut. Driving the Civic When you push the start button and finally start to drive the car, a noticeable feature is how visible everything is on the road and how open the ambience feels, mostly due to the sunroof, which allows a lot of light to enter inside the car which is always appreciated. Driving the actual car, the suspension in the Civic is brilliantly set where it takes small bumps at ease. The steering feels athletic where there is actual feedback when taking corners. The throttle response is great where the 1.5L turbo does not feel laggy and for a commuter, the 180hp and 240 Nm torque is plenty to feather with.           What intrigued Ahbaar Milky (in his own words) the most was how hard the CVT, when in sport mode, actually tried and successfully pretended to simulate 'gear shifts' akin to a DCT, albeit a sluggish one at that. Flick the drive mode selector downwards once and the digital cluster greets you with a dash of red, unlocking the joys of rowing through five simulated gears through the flappy paddles, which are ergonomically positioned just where your index fingers would grip the wheel when the hands are at 9 and 3. The paddles are tactile enough, having the same resistance and feel as the R1 and L1 buttons of a PlayStation controller, or a keyboard. Expect horrible economy on sport mode, obviously, as the CVT forces the engine to work overtime with instant throttle response if you're lead-footed. On the contrary, Normal and Economy modes do a solid job of keeping the drive experience seamless for hypermiling.           Verdict The new Civic is a great 'people's car' and it's the smallest details that make it just a bit more desirable all around. Driving the car does not feel like a chore and honestly, the whole package just makes sense. Although the E-Parking brake is the only thing that people could find annoying as it's small and the existence can easily slip off the dome (it happened twice with us). Coupled with the fantastic dampening on bumpy Dhaka roads, and the no-nonsense yet bang up to date interior, the new civic is already leagues ahead of the previous generation in our book. We just wish the wireless Apple CarPlay would work without any glitches on our test vehicle. There's a wireless charging pad though which worked with no hiccups.

"Many people are passionate about climate change, but not everybody should drive a battery electric vehicle as a means to combat climate change, Toyota Motor Corp Chief Scientist Gill Pratt said on Thursday at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit.Pratt's comments, during a discussion on electric vehicles, appeared to amplify remarks made over the past year by Toyota President Akio Toyoda.Toyota and other company officials have said that electric vehicles will play a greater role in reducing emissions, but other solutions should be used, Toyota's gasoline-electric hybrid models or hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles.At Thursday's conference, Pratt said Toyota believes in ""diversity of drivetrains"" to give customers different tools to reduce CO2.""It's not for us to predict which solution is the best or say only this will work,"" he said.Government incentives should be aimed at reducing carbon emissions, not picking which car technology is the best way to achieve those goals, Pratt added, in a reference to proposed bans on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, including hybrids, as a means of achieving carbon neutrality.Toyota was among major automakers that supported the Trump administration in its attempt to bar California from setting its own zero-emission requirements, but the company dropped that support earlier this year. Toyota has said it plans to invest $13.5 billion through 2030 on EV batteries, but so far its plans to roll out new battery electric vehicles (BEVs) seem relatively modest compared with those of US automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, which are spending around $30 billion each through 2025 to electrify more of their vehicle lines. Toyota executives continue to tout the merits of the company's hybrid vehicles, which have been on the market for more than 20 years.",tech_news
"At least 50% of British luxury carmaker Aston Martin's (AML.L) sales should be electric models by 2030, the company's top executive said on Tuesday.""I would say a minimum of 50% of our sales will be electric, possibly more,"" Aston Martin Chief Executive Tobias Moers said during the Reuters Events Automotive Summit.",tech_news
"Mercedes-Benz, the German company founded by the inventors of the motor car, is pouring more resources into its cutting-edge research and design capabilities in China as the centre of gravity of the new auto world shifts eastwards.In a drive to create a  ""home away from home"", Mercedes-Benz is doubling down on bases in Beijing and Shanghai to stay ahead of regulations and consumer trends in a car market that outstrips the United States and Germany combined.Three years after initially announcing plans to strengthen its research and development (R&D) in the country, the luxury car brand owned by Daimler will unveil its new Tech Center China in Beijing this month.Reuters has spoken to four people close to the tech centre and the brand's Chinese design studio who are familiar with the company's new China strategy. All declined to be named because they are not allowed to speak with the media.With 1,000 engineers, the new tech centre is more than three times the size of the one Mercedes-Benz opened in 2014 and the first outside Germany that can test  ""everything"", putting it more ""on par"" technically with the far bigger R&D headquarters near Stuttgart, a person close to the centre said.Mercedes-Benz has also invested significantly in upgrading its Chinese design studio and has moved the whole team from Beijing to Shanghai, a megalopolis of about 25 million people known as the car design capital of China.Mercedes-Benz has good reason to elevate its Chinese operations.Its car sales in China jumped 12% last year to a record 774,000 despite the pandemic, streets ahead of its next two markets, Germany on 286,000 and the United States with 275,000.  About 80% of the cars it sold in China were also made there, typically with an array of China-only features and models, and Asia overall accounted for almost half its global sales in 2021.China's auto market, the biggest in the world since 2009, is expected to carry on growing steadily, with demand forecast to reach 35 million vehicles by about 2030 versus 25 million now.'SECOND HOME'  But Mercedes-Benz, like all foreign automakers in China, is under growing pressure from local EV startups such as Xpeng, Li Auto and Nio and their stylish vehicles with high-tech features tailored to Chinese consumers.That's why the German carmaker's  ""second home"" strategy for China is focused on making its design and technology more agile, responding quickly to the ever-shifting landscape and to firmly entrench the Mercedes-Benz brand, the four sources said.""The expectations in China are for the in-car experience to be served by a localised digital services ecosystem, and such solutions must be conceived and built by people that live in China and truly understand the mobile internet,"" Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai, said.Mercedes-Benz customers in China are 36 years old on average - roughly 20 years younger than in Germany - and are more tech-savvy, but they are also notoriously disloyal, hopping from brand to brand as trends shift.Mercedes has spent 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million) upgrading the centre, with much of the investment ensuring it can do an array of testing locally - rather than send new technologies back to the Sindelfingen headquarters in Germany.""A key reason for the expansion is to gain the proximity to those customers and their needs,"" the person close to the tech centre said.  ""Here, we finally have everything we need to test the car fully,"" said the source.The centre has modern chassis test benches and others including for noise, vibration and harshness, as well as batteries and e-drive powertrains and it has the flexibility to swap in new ones as technology develops, two sources said.Mercedes has also added functions deemed important for Chinese customers, such as a team dedicated to intelligent, connected electric vehicle (EV) technology.""Tech-savvy customers here require that you're very local in terms of intelligence, connectivity and autonomous driving,"" one of the sources said.THINK ROSE GOLD  All four sources said a sharper focus on the customer in China in recent years is already paying off.A drive to create China-only colours led to research into the preferences of younger luxury goods buyers. While sensitive to being seen as hip and tech-savvy, there has been a revived interest in styles inspired by China's ancient dynasties.As part of that research, the studio came up with ""rose gold metallic"", a variation on rose gold tones adjusted for cars first used as an exterior colour for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class L sedan in 2018. New EVs such as the EQA and EQB now come in rose gold, and it's also an interior tone in the EQC.""Global ideas, inspired by China,"" said one source close to the studio, adding that while Mercedes needs to cater to its China customers first, some China-grown ideas will go global.Moving the studio to Shanghai was partly driven by the need to significantly speed up the design process by making it more digital, as most virtual model-making vendors are based there.""Besides, Shanghai is a lot easier a place to recruit design talent,"" said the source close to the studio, which is just north of the city's prime waterfront district The Bund.Designers typically sketch a car on paper or a touch-sensitive computer screen and expert modellers then help sculpt the designs into clay models. Mercedes-Benz plans to more or less do away with those physical models.Under the new process, the Shanghai studio will review its designs using virtual tools, except for the occasional quarter-size physical models, according to one of the four sources.If the studio makes it to the final of internal competitions for car designs, it will send designers and modellers to the main studio in Germany to create life-size models for the last round, the source said.RULES OF THE ROAD  Daimler's drive to strengthen its technology development in China also comes at a time when the cost of failing to be in step with Beijing policymakers has never been higher.Beijing's sweeping regulatory crackdown in recent months has wiped billions of dollars off the value of some of the country's best-known private firms and has weighed on the auto sector.That's partly because tensions between the United States and China have created a tricky environment for foreign companies to import technology developed elsewhere.And from battery technology to new kinds of mobility including smart connectivity and autonomous driving, Chinese policies and regulations are shifting and evolving rapidly.""If you respond to change after policies and regulation kick in, it's too late,"" said one of the contacts close to Daimler.With that in mind, the tech centre works closely with the brand's external affairs team which keeps its finger on the regulatory pulse - and that has proved key when it comes to so-called vehicle-to-everything, or V2X, technology.V2X controls communications between a car and  ""everything"" outside, from 5G cellular signals to low-earth-orbit satellites to smart traffic lights and cameras on the road.In China, vehicles will soon have to come with full-fledged V2X capabilities to achieve a top safety ranking under a new version of its vehicle safety evaluation system, or New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which is expected in 2025.""We knew this regulation was going to be implemented. We started developing those self-drive technologies including V2X to be in compliance with the new law and did so well before new regulation kicks in,"" one of the tech centre sources said.

"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today called for ensuring easy transfer of available technologies to developing nations so that they can face the toughest challenges of the 4th industrial revolution (4IR) in keeping pace with the developed countries.Joining virtually the closing ceremony of a conference on the 4IR from her official Gono Bhaban residence in Dhaka, she said her government has been taking various time-befitting policies and measures to face the upcoming challenges of the 4IR.The University Grants Commission (UGC) arranged the two-day international conference on the 4th Industrial Revolution at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre from December 10, marking the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the golden jubilee of country's independence.The prime minister said that the world is divided into two over creating affordable and green value-chains as rich nations invent technologies and enjoy their utility, and other countries are unable to invest in them.She added that scientists believe that humans will have to coexist with artificial intelligence in near future and some new challenges have to be tackled.""For example, machines will shrink the human workplace, demand for cheap labour will decrease, inequality will increase, and migration will be encouraged. Foreign investment in developing countries will reduce, and inequality in technological know-how will increase,"" she continued.The premier said that the 4th Industrial Revolution International Conference is a landmark step for development in Bangladesh.Industrialisation aims to improve the quality of life, create a market for new products, and accelerate the pace of economy through employment, she said.The premier added that the groundbreaking evolution of industrialisation after almost 100 consecutive years is remarkable. ""Passing the first, second, and third stages, we have reached the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution,"" she added.""I hope that the knowledge gained in this conference will create a strong rapport between our educational and industrial institutions. As a result, research and innovation related to the 4th Industrial Revolution will be easier to put into practice,"" she said.Since the formation of the government in 1996, she said, her government has focused on establishing IT infrastructure, formulating rules, and creating skilled citizens with technology.""We approved the establishment of 16 private universities and founded Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Bangabandhu Agricultural University. We started the work of setting up 12 science and technology universities. We established 15 polytechnic institutes and three women's polytechnic institutes,"" she told the function.The prime minister said they took effective measures by identifying 1,176 highly polluting industries and banned two-stroke three-wheelers since 1998. Her government has withdrawn duty on all agricultural machineries, she added.""We formulated up-to-date industrial policies to encourage the development of indigenous industries and investment. Intending to expand small and cottage industries, we established 57 industrial towns and started establishing another 13. In FY 2000-2001, we increased the power generation to 4,300 MW,"" she further said.She said the 1991-95 BNP regime refused to receive free fibre optic cable connections in Bangladesh. So, the country became isolated from global information technology highways, she added.""We formed the government and adopted new policies to develop this sector. We took the initiative to build IT-village and hi-tech park to develop software, data-entry, and data-processing industries. We allowed duty-free import of computers, computer parts, and software,"" she said.She said that they prepared the ground for the development of information technology by breaking the monopoly on mobile phones and V-SAT installations.The premier mentioned that in 1996, the number of mobile phones was only 2,000, and the price of each was more than 100 thousand taka. In 2001, the number of mobile telephones stood at around 700 thousand, and the average price was 7,000 taka.As a result, millions of people are employed to manufacture and assemble computer parts, make software, and do data processing, she added.The prime minister said they have been working to build a Digital Bangladesh by 2021 as well as to introduce innovative technology in the industrial sector. ""As a result, the number of internet users has now exceeded 120 million. We are launching 5-G Network Service soon. It will completely change the business model, education system, standard of living, and conventional digital and social media,"" she said.""We have transformed post offices into digital centres. We've connected Union Digital Centres to fibre optical cables, set up Sheikh Russel Digital Labs at educational institutions, and designed thousands of interactive content and e-books,"" she said.She continued: ""We have added small/cottage industries to the e-commerce platform. We are making increasing progress in automation, software development, and freelancing. I believe that the ICT and software industry will lead our export sector in the future.""The premier added that they are giving special incentives to overseas industries to set up research-development and manufacturing centres in Bangladesh.""Many companies, including Nokia, Samsung, Huawei, are working in high- tech parks.

"Rohingya refugees sued Facebook on Monday for $150 billion over claims the social network is failing to stem hate speech on its platform, exacerbating violence against the vulnerable minority.The complaint, lodged in a California court, says the algorithms that power the US-based company promote disinformation and extremist thought that translates to real-world violence.""Facebook is like a robot programmed with a singular mission: to grow,"" the court document states.""The undeniable reality is that Facebook's growth, fueled by hate, division, and misinformation, has left hundreds of thousands of devastated Rohingya lives in its wake.""The mainly Muslim group faces widespread discrimination in Myanmar, where they are despised as interlopers despite having lived in the country for generations.A military-backed campaign that the United Nations said amounted to genocide saw hundreds of thousands of Rohingya driven across the border into Bangladesh in 2017, where they have since lived in sprawling refugee camps.Many others remain in Myanmar, where they are not permitted citizenship and are subject to communal violence, as well as official discrimination by the ruling military junta.The legal complaint argues that Facebook's algorithms drive susceptible users to join ever-more extreme groups, a situation that is ""open to exploitation by autocratic politicians and regimes.""Rights groups have long charged that Facebook does not do enough to prevent the spread of disinformation and misinformation online.Critics say even when alerted to hate speech on its platform, the company fails to act.They charge that the social media giant allows falsehoods to proliferate, affecting the lives of minorities and skewing elections in democracies such as the United States, where unfounded charges of fraud circulate and intensify among like-minded friends.This year, a huge leak by a company insider sparked articles arguing Facebook, whose parent company is now called Meta, knew its sites could harm some of their billions of users -- but executives chose growth over safety.Whistleblower Frances Haugen told the US Congress in October that Facebook is ""fanning ethnic violence"" in some countries.Under US law, Facebook is largely protected from liability over content posted by its users.The Rohingya lawsuit, anticipating this defense, argues that where applicable, the law of Myanmar -- which has no such protections -- should prevail in the case.Facebook, which did not immediately respond to questions about the lawsuit, has been under pressure in the United States and Europe to clamp down on false information, particularly over elections and the coronavirus.The company has forged partnerships with several media companies, including AFP, intended to verify online posts and remove those that are untrue.",tech_news
"Parag Agrawal was recently appointed as Twitter's CEO, again raising the question why so many India-born techies have the corner offices of the world's most influential Silicon Valley companies.Indian-origin people account for just about one percent of the US population and six percent of Silicon Valley's workforce -- and yet are disproportionately represented in the top brass, reports BBC.Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, and the top bosses of IBM, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, VMWare and Vimeo are all of Indian descent.""No other nation in the world 'trains' so many citizens in such a gladiatorial manner as India does,"" the BBC reports quotes R Gopalakrishnan, former executive director of Tata Sons and co-author of ""The Made in India Manager"" as saying.""From birth certificates to death certificates, from school admissions to getting jobs, from infrastructural inadequacies to insufficient capacities,"" growing up in India equips Indians to be ""natural managers"", he adds, quoting the famous Indian corporate strategist C K Prahalad.The competition and chaos make them adaptable problem-solvers. They also often prioritise the professional over the personal helps in an American office culture of overwork, Gopalakrishnan adds.""These are characteristics of top leaders anywhere in the world,"" he says.India-born Silicon Valley CEOs are also part of a four million-strong minority group that is among the wealthiest and most educated in the US.About a million of them are scientists and engineers. More than 70 percent of H-1B visas -- work permits for foreigners -- issued by the US go to Indian software engineers, and 40 percent of all foreign-born engineers in cities like Seattle are from India, states the BBC report.""This is the result of a drastic shift in US immigration policy in the 1960s,"" according to the authors of ""The Other One Percent: Indians in America"".In the wake of the civil rights movement, national-origin quotas were replaced by those that gave preference to skills and family unification. Soon after, highly-educated Indians -- scientists, engineers and doctors at first, and then, overwhelmingly, software programmers -- began arriving in the US, BBC explains from the book.This cohort of Indian immigrants did not ""resemble any other immigrant group from any other nation,"" the authors say. They were ""triply selected"" -- not only were they among the upper-caste privileged Indians who could afford to go to a reputed college, but they also belonged to a smaller sliver that could finance a masters in the US, which many of Silicon Valley's CEOs possess. And finally, the visa system further narrowed it down to those with specific skills -- often in science, technology, engineering and maths or STEM as the preferred category is known -- that meet the US' ""high-end labour market needs"".""This is the cream of the crop and they are joining companies where the best rise to the top,"" reports BBC quoting technology entrepreneur and academic Vivek Wadhwa as explaining. ""The networks they have built [in Silicon Valley] have also given them an advantage - the idea was that they would help each other.""Wadhwa adds that many of the India-born CEOs have also worked their way up the company ladder -- and this, he believes, gives them a sense of humility that distinguishes them from many founder-CEOs who have been accused of being arrogant and entitled in their vision and management.Wadhwa says men like Nadella and Pichai also bring a certain amount of caution, reflection and a ""gentler"" culture that makes them ideal candidates for the top job -- especially at a time when big tech's reputation has plummeted amid Congressional hearings, rows with foreign governments and the widening gulf between Silicon Valley's richest and the rest of America.There are more obvious reasons as well. The fact that so many Indians can speak English makes it easier for them to integrate into the diverse US tech industry. And Indian education's emphasis on math and science has created a thriving software industry, training graduates in the right skills, which are further buttressed in top engineering or management schools in the US, BBC reports.",tech_news

4,"There have been insinuations, remarks and opinions regarding all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan's involvement in Test cricket from the media, cricket experts and even board officials.Looking back, Shakib had missed a few Tests in recent years, lending credibility to arguments about his lack of interest in Tests. Opting out of the New Zealand tour and the consequent drama has put these arguments back in focus. However, there exist finer points between the two arguments that 'Shakib doesn't want to play Tests' and 'Shakib doesn't enjoy Tests'.The second Test against Pakistan in Dhaka, which Bangladesh came very close to grinding out a draw from yesterday, showcased Shakib's enjoyment but also the demotivating factors.Shakib played one of his very special knocks under pressure, but in the end the result did not go in Bangladesh's favour. When that happens, how does Shakib feel?Shakib's ability to not allow anyone to dictate terms was once again on display as he did not let the bowlers feel they were on top of him for a moment. How he dealt with spinners was exemplary. The Pakistan spin duo had a general plan for the Bangladesh batters, getting the ball to pitch right in front of the bat and getting that slight turn to do the trick for them.Shakib was able to adjust remarkably within the same delivery, from a front foot to a slightly back foot stance. He did not need to release shots like Mushfiqur Rahim for instance, but was able to make adjustments late to keep scoring. From a pressure situation, Shakib had a groove about him which took Bangladesh close to a result.A pivotal moment came when Mehedi Hasan Miraz got out to another sweep in the second innings which saw Pakistan come back into the game. As soon as the umpire had signaled not out and Pakistan went for the review, Shakib vehemently chastised Mehedi for playing that shot. Mehedi's two dismissals were significant to the fate of the match.Without arguing in Shakib's favour, when a good player sees the supporting cast fail alongside the team processes, any player has a tendency to be demotivated.Shakib's long-term mentor Nazmul Abedeen Fahim analysed the scenario for The Daily Star.""In the first innings, he counter-attacked to avoid the follow-on due to match scenario. In the second innings, I was relieved to see that he wanted to play good cricket. What he did was very difficult because you need to be in the groove for a long period of time. Unless you love the game and the challenge, you can't do that. One of his best innings,"" Fahim said.""If he was careless, he wouldn't be able to play like that,"" he said.However, once Miraz got out, Shakib changed too, even playing a lofted shot over mid-off that fell short, pointing to his dwindling morale.""Take the case of Mahmudullah Riyad. He was told some 17 months before his Test retirement that he wouldn't be considered [for Tests]. How demotivated must he have felt? But his decision was like shooting yourself in the foot. It became an emotional thing and players are going through such demotivation at the moment,"" Fahim dictated.It cannot be argued that there exists a gap in quality between the generation of the Big Five and the current crop of players.When there are no correct procedures and the existence of haphazard selection process alongside bad results on the pitch, players will find a way to relieve workload or responsibility.That may very well be the phase Shakib's Test career is going through. Not a lack of enjoyment but an existence of demotivation.",sports

6,"""The pic you've been waiting for,"" read the post from Barcelona's official Twitter account last month, above a photo of the team's new coach Xavi Hernandez talking to a smiling Frenkie de Jong.Xavi was barely into his second week as coach but the hope was that he would already have De Jong nestled under his wing, the advice flowing from one midfielder to another and the clock counting down until the flourishing of another Dutch master in Barcelona colours.For three years now, including two in Spain and his final one at Ajax, the destiny of De Jong has, through no fault of his own, defined almost everything about him as a footballer.His performances have been up and down, and mostly somewhere in between. He has been an obvious pick in Barca's starting line-up but only occasionally a stand-out performer.Against Elche at Camp Nou on Saturday, he was substituted in the second half and whistled by some of his own fans.""Maybe you don't see what he does but he's very good,"" said Xavi.""I don't think I have ever done really badly, but I know I can do better,"" De Jong told AFP in an interview last year.In some ways, the promise of what De Jong can be has been all-consuming.Honed by Ajax and instrumental for the Dutch national team, De Jong owned the two fundamental characteristics to be considered a carrier of 'Barca DNA'.As a child, he even did multiple stadium tours of Camp Nou and wore a shirt with Lionel Messi's name on the back.Perhaps the only way the anticipation could grow further was through a transfer scramble, which was provided when Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City joined the race for De Jong's signature in 2018.It was a fight Barcelona could not afford to lose.Excitement around De Jong had been building ever since he helped engineer Ajax's dismantling of Real Madrid in the Champions League, while Barca's own failures in the tournament meant the craving for young talent had morphed into something closer to desperation.There was political pressure too.The club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu faced anger about repeated capitulations and an increasingly unrecognisable style of play, all on the back of Neymar's humiliating departure to PSG.- Poster boy -The prospect of PSG, a state-funded club, with its perceived lack of identity or history, again beating Barcelona to a player like De Jong, a poster boy for almost everything Barca stood for, was unthinkable.Barcelona paid 75 million euros for De Jong, with a further 11 million euros due in variables, and a club announcement explained in its third paragraph how ""the president Josep Maria Bartomeu and CEO Oscar Grau were personally involved in closing the deal"".""In some ways I've always been a Barcelona player,"" said De Jong, with Camp Nou behind him.Yet in the rush to be seen to buy young, bolster the team's identity, beat PSG and boost the popularity of the president - what was Barcelona's plan for De Jong?How did they expect to improve or even accommodate this talented 21-year-old?In the first game of the season, Barcelona's then-coach Ernesto Valverde offered a show of faith by fielding him ahead of Sergio Busquets. But Barca struggled, Busquets was restored and De Jong shifted to the right of the midfield three.In his two and a half years, De Jong has played right, left, defensive and attacking midfield, as well as right-wing and centre-back. He has played under four permanent coaches, seen Messi leave and Barcelona surrender its status as a serious European club.His best position remains unclear and his future is now in question.Barcelona's financial meltdown means any significant sale is always tempting and De Jong has been linked to both Manchester clubs in recent weeks.He would likely fetch more than 50 million euros in either January or the summer transfer window.For now, the onus is on De Jong to take what could be his last chance under Xavi, to satisfy lofty expectations and make good on a signing that was arguably seen as an end in itself, with too little thought for what came next.",sports
7,"Bangladesh suffered an embarrassing defeat by an innings and eight runs against Pakistan in the rain-affected second Test of the two-match Test series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur.  Having crumbled to 87 all out in the morning on the fifth day, the hosts were asked to follow on while trailing by 213 runs. And after 83 overs of batting in the second innings, the Tigers were bundled out for 205.   After two 40+ knocks from Liton Das and Mushfiqur rahim in the second innings, Bangladesh at one stage found themselves at 198 for six after 75 overs and were in with a chance of salvaging a draw after Shakib scored a successive team-highest score and more importantly had brought up an impressive fifty partnership with Mehedi Hasan Miraz.But then Pakistan skipper Babar Azam pulled a rabbit out of the hat and decided to bring himself on to bowl the second over of his Test career, in an attempt to break the seventh-wicket stand. The decision immediately paid dividends for the visitors as Miraz was trapped in front trying to play across the line. Miraz's patient 70-ball 14-run knock was spoiled by the sweep shot, which also got the better of him in the first innings.    There was still some light at the end of tunnel for the Tigers with Shakib Al Hasan still at the crease. However, he too departed in the next over, on 63 off 130 balls, having failed to read a sharp turning delivery from Sajid Khan which ended up dismantling the off stump.Sajid went on to scalp the wickets of Khaled Mahmud and Taijul Islam after Taijul and Ebadot Hossain frustrated the visitors with a 34-ball partnership for the last wicket stand.With four wickets in the second innings, Sajid accomplished a stellar 12-wicket haul in his fourth appearance in Tests while Pakistan add maximum ICC World Test Championships points with a 2-0 series win against Bangladesh.",sports
8,"Premier allrounder Shakib Al Hasan has achieved another career milestone as he became the quickest player to reach the elite club of players with 4000 runs and 200 wickets in Test cricket.After scoring a team-highest of 33 in the first innings of the Dhaka Test yesterday, Shakib was 34 runs short of the landmark on his 59th appearance for the Tigers in the longest format. And with a inside-out drive to Sajid Khan for a boundary in the 56th over of the second innings, the champion performer finds himself among the illustrious company of the likes of Gary Sobers, Ian Botham, Kapil Dev, Jacques Kallis and Daniel Vettori.The left-hander, currently batting to salvage a draw for his side against the odds on the final session of the Test against Pakistan, took 10 Tests fewer than Botham, who acheived the double feat from 69 appearances. Despite being wicketless in the ongoing Test, Shakib boasts 215 wickets in his tally so far, 20 short of Sobers. ",sports
9,"Mushfiqur Rahim fell two runs short of a half century as Bangladesh keep spiralling deep into trouble on the fifth day of the Dhaka Test.At Tea, Bangladesh are trembling at 147 for 6 after 52.1 overs, with a session left to play on the fifth day of the second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.When Mushfiqur attempted a reverse sweep to Sajid Khan in the 48th over of the second innings, the writing was on the wall for the experienced batter it seemed. And just at the stroke of Tea, Mushfiqur lost the plot completely when he called for a cheeky single and then managed to ran himself out at the striker's end after his 136-ball 48-run knock. The umpire was reluctant to pass the call to third umpire at first but replays showed that Mushfiqur failed to slide the bat onto the ground by the moment wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan dislodged the bails.     Shakib Al Hasan is unbeaten on 25 off 56 deliveries and will be hoping to get all the support from the likes of Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam.  Pakistan, on the other hand, will be looking to wrap up this game and clean sweep the Test series as early as possible, in case bad light stops play prematurely. Shaheen Afridi, Hasan Ali has scalped two wicket for the visitors while Sajid Khan, the star of the first innings with a eight-for, picked the important wicket of Liton Das. ",sports
10,"Bangladesh surpassed their first innings tally of 87 to reach three figures in the second innings before Liton Das perished as the hosts trail by 104 runs at the first drinks break of the post-lunch session after being enforced a follow-on by Pakistan on the fifth and final day of the Dhaka Test.  The Tigers are in deep water at 109 for five after 38 overs. Shakib Al Hasan, the team-highest scorer of the first innings, has joined Mushfiqur Rahim, on 31 off 97 balls, at the crease.  Liton began the post-lunch session by bringing up the fifty partnership with Mushfiqur for the fifth wicket, as he rocked on the backfoot to pull a Sajid Khan loose, short delivery past the short leg.However, the partnership could only last up to 73 runs as a similar delivery and shot ten overs later brought the downfall of Liton, on 45 off 81 deliveries. This time around, a fielder in Fawad Alam was present at square leg to a take a straightforward catch, much to the delight of Sajid, who added another victim after his eight-wicket haul in the first innings.  Earlier in the session, the wicketkeeper batter got lucky against Shaheen Afridi in the next over when an inside edge from a half-hearted defensive stroke narrowly missed the leg stump.Both Liton and Mushfiqur had played proactively on a wicket which has dried up in the sun and looked in a better shape, comparatively than yesterday, for batters. Still, Pakistan bowlers, especially Afridi, has never looked far from breaking the partnership with his movement, pace and bounce.And more promising signs popped up for the visitors as Sajid got one to bounce awkwardly high for Liton in the middle of the 30th over but Liton got lucky again as the ball landed on the vacant silly point area off his glove.However, it did not require a brilliant delivery nor did the fifth day pitch had any role with the manner Liton got out.

11,"Bangladesh batters Mushfiqur Rahim and Liton Das put on some resistance following the Tigers' top-order collapse after Pakistan had put the hosts to follow-on on the final day of their second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh were able to score 72 for four before umpires signaled for lunch. However, the Tigers, who are following on, still trail by 141 runs. The duo of Mushfiqur and Liton brought some stability in the middle, stitching together an unbeaten 47-run fifth-wicket stand, which is also the highest total so far by Bangladesh in this game.Mushfiqur remained unbeaten on16 off 52 deliveries while Liton, who had started very cautiously as he took 21 balls to open his account, notched up a gear after settling in. Liton pounced on the loose deliveries by Pakistan spinners Nauman Ali and Sajid Khan as the right-hander smashed a total of four boundaries during his unbeaten 46-ball 27. Earlier, Pakistan's pace duo of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Hasan Ali ran riot as they took two wickets each to put Bangladesh in a precarious situation. It was the same old struggle of Bangladesh batters against the pace and swing of the Pakistani pacers that saw the Tigers reeling at 25 for four at one stage of the game. Before that, Pakistan had bundled out Bangladesh for 87, the lowest-ever total in Tests in Mirpur, to enforce a follow-on.   ",sports
12,"Bangladesh's fragile top-order was once again exposed by the pace threat of Pakistan as the Tigers lost four wickets inside the first 10 overs after being put to follow-on on the final day of their second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. After 11 overs, Bangladesh were left reeling at 27 for four with Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Hasan Ali scalping two wickets each. It was the same old struggle of Bangladesh batters against the pace and swing of the Pakistan pace duo. Debutant Mahmudul Hasan Joy was the first to depart, failing to negotiate a Hasan delivery that nipped in to rattle the right-hander's stumps. Shadman Islam was soon undone by Shaheen as the left-handed batter failed to get his bat down in time and was trapped in front when the pacer had one come back inward after having swung the cherry away for the most occasions. Hasan then had Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque suffer the same fate. But the wicket was only confirmed after a long review as it seemed Mominul's bat was very near to the ball when it hit his pad. The other wicket of Najmul Hossain Shanto was a perfectly executed plan by Pakistan. Having two gullies in place, Shaheen bowled accordingly as his back of a length delivery had squared Shanto up, forcing him to give a catch to one of the fielders at gully. Bangladesh's top-order display has remained abysmal throughout the series. The top four batters accumulated a total of 34 runs in the first innings of this Test, in which the Tigers were bundled out for 87, their lowest total in Mirpur. Also, in the first Test in Chattogram, the same four batsmen were only able to score a total of 67 runs in both the innings of a game that Bangladesh lost by eight wickets.        ",sports
13,"Bangladesh were put to follow-on as the hosts were bundled out for just 87 runs in the early hours of the final day of their second Test against Pakistan at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Having resumed the day on 76 for seven, Bangladesh required 25 more runs to avoid follow-on. But the Tigers were only able to add 11 on the day, succumbing to their lowest-ever total in Mirpur. The previous lowest total at the venue is 110, also by Bangladesh against Sri Lanka in a Test in 2018.However, Bangladesh's 87-run total is the joint-lowest total in the country. In 2002, West Indies had bundled out Bangladesh for 87 runs at the Bangabandhu National Stadium.   Pakistan off-spinner Sajid Khan, who ran through the Tigers' batting order and scalped six wickets yesterday, gave the visitors their first breakthrough on the day when he had tailender Taijul Islam trapped in front in his very first over. With the sun out for the first time in three days, Pakistan skipper Babar Azam was able to employ pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi from one end as the pacer had started terrorising the Tigers from the word go. The left-arm quick broke through the defenses of Khaled Ahmed, who had no answer to his searing yorker in the day's third over. However, despite losing two wickets very early on the day, the urgency from the Bangladeshi batters continued. Shakib looked to score runs quickly, probably trying to get to the 101-run mark that would see them avoid follow-on. However, his efforts soon came to an end as he gifted his wicket, much like the other Bangladesh batters. He charged down to hit Sajid and only ended up giving an easy catch to the fielder at short-midwicket as Bangladesh's first-innings came to an end in just 32 overs. Sajid, who picked up two wickets today, ended with his career-best figures of eight for 42 in 15 overs that included four maidens.          ",sports
14,"Bangladesh team director and former national skipper Khaled Mahmud pointed at Bangladesh batters' lack of patience, which led the hosts on the verge of a defeat against Pakistan on the second Test after fourth day's play in Mirpur today.Instead of going for the cautious approach with just over a session to play, after Pakistan declared their first innings on 300 for four at the stroke of Tea, almost all Bangladesh batters were guilty of throwing away their wickets as the Tigers found themselves struggling on 76 for seven, while still needing 25 runs to avoid follow-on, at stumps. ""I have seen the game from upstairs. I don't know why that happened,"" a surprised Mahmud told the media today.  ""There was lack of patience but even though we understand Test batting, still, we were unable to do that. Why this is happening, is something to think about. There was spin in the pitch and their spinners were also bowling well but we do have the ability to play quality spinners. ""Why they couldn't do it or what was the reason to hurry, I don't know. All I Know is that we were supposed to bat the entire day as the Test will finish in the next day [tomorrow] with four or four-and-half sessions left to play. We should learn from Azhar Ali, the way he batted by taking a lot of time at the crease,"" Mahmud added. Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi pacers also came close to the forefront with the likes of Ebadot Hossain and Khaled Ahmed unable to make an impact in the Test series.Asked about when Bangladesh will get good quality fast bowlers, Mahmud replied, ""When Allah wishes, what else I could say! You may train a lot and you could be six feet tall and also have good pace but the coach can't instil everything in you. Coaches can only show you the way and it's you who will have to do it,"" he concluded.",sports
15,"Bangladesh batter Nazmul Hossain Shanto insisted that not every player played as aggressively as it seemed on the fourth day of their second Test against Pakistan in Mirpur today.Pakistan declared their first innings after scoring 300 for four in 98.3 overs. In reply, Bangladesh's batting collapsed, unable to tackle Pakistan's spin threat as the Tigers were left reeling at 76 for seven before stumps on day four.Bangladesh's batters threw their wickets away as they seemed to be in a rush to collect runs. However, Shanto believed that not all the batters displayed such aggression.""It's not like everyone played aggressively. Each of the batters tried to play the shots they're good at, but probably couldn't execute,"" Shanto said in the press conference after the day's play today.""Execution doesn't happen everyday, it didn't happen today but may happen in the next innings. It's not that we can't execute or have never done it before,"" he added.Even though Bangladesh need 25 runs to avoid follow-on with only three wickets left in hand, the left-handed batter believes the Tigers are still in the game.""I think tomorrow is very important. If Shakib [Al Hasan] bhai and Taijul [Islam] bhai can build a partnership and we can score some more runs then we can have a good chance.""We have the opportunity to bat again tomorrow, and we need to bat really well in order to save the match,"" Shanto said.The visitors had an easier time playing on Mirpur's wicket than the hosts. However, Shanto stated that the wicket was quite challenging to play defensively.""The wicket really wasn't that easy. It's difficult to play defensive shots and spend the entire day.""I don't think this is a wicket to score 300 runs. The spinners and pacers should've conceded fewer runs, the condition was in favour of the seamers. There's no use of thinking about these anymore, we need to ensure not to repeat the same mistakes in the next innings,"" Shanto concluded.",sports
16,"Woeful batting by Bangladesh on the fourth day of the rain-affected Dhaka Test has brought life back into second Test of the two-match Test series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur.At stumps on Day 4, The hosts find themselves in a precarious yet familiar territory, on 76 for seven after 26 overs in their first innings, and are looking to first pile up a total of 101 to avoid follow-on from here with Taijul Islam set to resume fifth day's action at the crease with Shakib Al Hasan on strike, who has played a 23 off 32-ball knock so far. After Pakistan declared their first innings at 300 for four at the stroke of Tea, Bangladesh top-order had a big advantage as Babar Azam was forced to operate exclusively with spinners due to insufficient light on ground. Shaheen Afridi only got to bowl a solitary over, the first of the innings, and he looked threatening from the word go.  However, it only took Sajid Khan to topple six out of seven batters to have fallen for the hosts, with the other being the dismissal of skipper Mominul, who needlessly tried to sneak a risky single against the run of play and was run-out at the non-striker's end.And the latest to depart was Mehedy Hasan Miraz on naught, who had his off stump dislodged by the right-handed off-spinner, apparently having the game of his life.  All seven batters to have fallen for Bangladesh so far, apart from Najmul Hossain Shanto (30), went out in disappointing fashion, which were against the demand of the game scenario from Bangladesh's perspective.Both Liton Das (6) and debutant Mahmudul Hasan Joy (0) brought their demise by trying to dance down the wicket to combat Sajid, even though the debutant offered a defensive shot unlike Liton, who got caught-and-bowled trying clear mid-on area. And opener Shadman Islam (3) mistimed a forceful cut shot while veteran Mushfiqur Rahim (5) went down attempting to hoick over mid-wicket.The bulk of the bowling was done by Sajid and Nauman Ali, the duo having bowled 24 out of 26 overs for Pakistan. Nauman could have dismissed Shanto earlier on 21 had he not bowled a no-ball. At the end of the day, even skipper Babar chipped in with an over while Sajid boasted an impressive 35 for six in 12 overs. With the latest shambolic display by the Tigers, it is good news however for the Pakistan fans, also the neutrals, as the visitors now have a shot at winning the second Test, which saw only 63.2 overs played in the first three days of play and was destined for a draw, with the rain having had washed out entire third day's action.",sports

Despite getting set at the crease, a majority were guilty of throwing away their wickets.

Pacer Robiul removed both the openers, with Mohammad Ashraful departing on a duck after he was caught at slip while going for a drive away from his body.Young Shahadat Hossain Dipu then paired with skipper Imrul Kayes and added 51 runs for the second wicket before the latter became Robiul's second victim, handing a straightforward catch to fine leg off a loose delivery.Hider then picked up his first wicket, removing Irfan Shukkur (14), before Murad took a return catch to dismiss Afif Hossain for a duck.Shahadat looked solid and reached his fifty off 99 balls with a gorgeous cover drive to Hider but he too perished as he was trapped leg before by Murad after scoring 72 off 132 balls.After that, Hider ensured his first game of the season would count as he rattled through the East Zone lower-middle order and ended with figures of five for 93. Nayeem Hasan fought a lone battle with the bat in the end for East Zone and was unbeaten on 40.At the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram, veteran Naeem Islam struck his 28th first-class ton as BCB North Zone ended the first day on 246 for four against BCB South Zone.North Zone were initially in a spot of bother after being asked to bat as off-spinner Nahidul Islam removed openers Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Parvez Hossain Emon for ducks. Left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed then trapped Junaid Siddique leg before to leave North Zone struggling on 24 for three before Naeem and skipper Marshall Ayub steadied the ship, adding ninety for the fourth wicket.However, Marshall was dismissed for 47 and Naeem then paired with Mahidul Islam Ankon and added an unbeaten 132-run stand for the fifth wicket. Naeem remained not out on 126 runs off 297 balls, smashing 14 fours and a six, while Ankon was unbeaten on 53.",sports

It capped what would have been a forgettable day for Root and his team if only it had not been etched as deeply in his memory as he burned with pain.Root was absent from the field throughout yesterday's first session after being hit in the unprotected zone by a member of the support staff providing gentle throwdowns before play began, but returned only to cop a far more ferocious hit from Starc shortly before stumps.Travis Head (51 off 54 balls) led the charge for quickfire runs on day four before Jhye Richardson (2-17) shone under lights to edge the home side closer to victory.England's problems stem from being bowled out, after a batting collapse, for 236 on Saturday in reply to Australia's 473 for nine declared.England are still 386 runs adrift, facing the near impossible task of batting out three sessions on the final day to salvage a draw with only six wickets remaining and the world's number one ranked Test batsman back in the pavilion.The hosts resumed their second innings at 45 for one and declared on 230 for nine midway through the second session, giving their bowlers a crack at England with the pink ball as twilight loomed.They immediately made inroads with Jhye Richardson steaming in to Haseeb Hameed and the ball flying off his glove to wicketkeeper Alex Carey without scoring.Dawid Malan, who hit 80 in the first innings, was dropped by Steve Smith, but only lasted three more balls before debutant Michael Neser trapped him lbw for 20.Opener Rory Burns was desperate for a big score after a lean spell and managed 34, but was then beaten by Richardson's sheer pace, edging to Smith at slip.",sports

""This means a lot to the team and this acts as the start for the global qualifiers for the big tournaments coming up,"" the Gujarat-born wicketkeeper added.US optimism is also based on the emergence of a promising crop of youth players, which includes highly-rated wicketkeeper Rahul Jariwala, 17, and 19-year-old left-arm spinner Vatsal Vaghela, who have both earned call-ups for the first time.Both come from Northern California and impressed recently in a 50-over National Championships.Led by San Francisco 49ers executive CEO Paraag Marathe, USA Cricket has reformed and refocused, not only looking to establish strong community links but also pushing the national team further into the conversation.USA Cricket claims there are over 200,000 playing at the grassroots, mostly of South Asian heritage.National success would help raise interest levels in the sport and although qualification for the most recent Twenty20 World Cup ended in failure, with another opportunity up for grabs in 2022, joining the party in Australia is a realistic ambition.",sports

28," The Daily Star (DS): Welcome to Bangladesh. How do you feel after coming to your second home after such a long period?Margarita Mamun (MM): It is my first visit after the Rio Olympic Games and I'm really happy and amazed to have received such a warm welcome from Bangladeshi people. I'm really happy to be here with my family. My mother is here, after 15 years, as well as my husband and our two-year-old son, who are here for the first time.DS: You were 10 when you came to visit your grandfather's home in Rajshahi? Can you recall memories from that trip which took place 15 years ago?MM: I can remember in flashbacks but I have a lot of pictures and videos from that trip. I think I will visit the beautiful Rajshahi next time when I come back with more time in hand. Of course, this will not be our last visit here.DS: Take us to the beginning of your gymnastics career.  What made you choose the sport?MM: After seeing rhythmic gymnastics on television, I just liked it so much that my mother had to take me out to play the sport.DS: We know your mother was also a rhythmic gymnast, who perhaps inspired you but what about the role of your father -- Abdullah Al Mamun -- in your career?MM: My mother was an aspiring gymnast. Unfortunately, she only had a couple of months of training because her parents couldn't take her to the training every day. My father was always supportive and was proud of me, starting from when I achieved medals at the age-level to the ones at European Championships and World Cup.DS: How challenging was your experience as a rhythmic gymnast in Russia?MM: I practiced every day, almost 24 hours (big laugh) I think. In Russia, as there are too many talented girls, it was extremely hard to pursue a place in the national team. There was a time when I almost competed for Bangladesh, even though there was no rhythmic gymnastics in Bangladesh at that time. My father knew Mamun [Bashir Ahmed], who was the president of the Bangladesh Gymnastic Federation at that time but then my head coach Irina Viner intervened and gave me the opportunity to feature for the Russian national team.DS: But you once represented Bangladesh during your childhood.MM: Yes, it was an international competition held in Germany but not recognised by FIG [International Gymnastics Federation]. I think Bangladeshi people are happy to know that I once competed for Bangladesh. My father had also brought the Bangladeshi press when I became world champion in 2013 and he showed me how to celebrate with the people. DS: You have been known as the Bengal Tiger. Can you tell the story behind it?MM:  After the London Olympics 2020, I became the Russian national team's number one and had the spotlight from the press. Coach Irina knew my background. She told the journalists that they can call me Bengal Tiger as I'm half Bengali and the journalists picked it up from there.DS: Why did you call time after winning gold at Rio at the age of 20, whereas most athletes usually take part in the Olympics for more than one occasion?MM: Among many reasons, I had some injury concerns and health-related issues, so I decided before the Rio Olympics that it would be my first and last Olympics. I had already been a world champion at the age of 17 by then.DS: What keeps you occupied these days?MM: I am now a full-time mom who prioritises the family because I didn't often see my family when I was in training. But now, I think that after this trip when I go back home, I will discuss with Mr. Mamun [Bashir Ahmed] how I can help my second home.DS: What advice do you have for Bangladeshi athletes who are trying to improve their standard to compete at the world-class level?MM: I know Bangladesh is still waiting to win an Olympic medal. The big question is: How Bangladeshi athletes can achieve the highest results? I think I can assist, maybe not as a coach but maybe as a United Nations ambassador where I can inspire aspiring athletes to become bold dreamers. I think the impact has to be in all walks of life, not just on the sporting or the professional front.DS: Finally, do you know the Bengali language, and if so, would you like to say something in Bengali to the readers of The Daily Star?MM: Of course! When I was young, my father taught me the numbers: Ek, dui, tin, char, paach, chhoy, shat, aat, noy and dosh. I know some Bengali words like Shundor [beautiful] and one phrase, which is: Aami Bangladesh ke bhalobashi [I love Bangladesh].",sports

36,"Manchester City's Joao Cancelo scored one goal and made another as they overwhelmed struggling Newcastle United 4-0 on Sunday to ensure they will spend Christmas Day top of the Premier League.The visitors were gifted the opening goal in the fifth minute when Cancelo acrobatically crossed for Ruben Dias to head into an empty net after a mix-up between Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and defender Ciaran Clarke.Cancelo added a second in the 27th minute, cutting in from the right wing and capping off a solo run with a stunning strike to silence the home crowd.Newcastle were denied what looked to be a clear penalty on the half-hour mark when City keeper Ederson clattered into Ryan Fraser, but neither referee Martin Atkinson nor the VAR decided to intervene.Despite starting the second half with a pair of fine saves from Dubravka, things got worse for Newcastle as Mahrez turned home Kevin De Bruyne's cross from the left wing with a deft volley in the 63rd minute to notch his 50th Premier League goal.Newcastle had introduced Allan Saint-Maximin off the bench at halftime for Joe Willock but they only managed one effort on target over the 90 minutes - a close-range header from Callum Wilson that forced a superb one-handed save from Ederson.Sterling's industrious performance on the wing was rewarded in the 86th as Gabriel Jesus drove the ball across the goal and the England forward slammed it home to complete the rout.The dominant performance keeps City top on 44 points, four ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who visit Tottenham Hotspur later on Sunday, and six clear of Chelsea in third after they were held to a 0-0 draw at Wolverhampton Wanderers.Newcastle stay second-bottom on 10 points.

39,"Hosts Bangladesh completed their first-ever Asian Champions Trophy campaign in fifth position among five teams following a 6-2 defeat to former world champions Pakistan in the last pool match at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium yesterday.Pakistan, who needed a point to qualify for the last four, finished third and the margin of victory helped them avoid defending champions India in the semifinals. Pakistan grabbed third position by virtue of superior goal difference over Japan, who in the day's first match suffered a 6-0 defeat to table-toppers India.Pakistan will take on second-placed South Korea while India will square off against Japan in the semifinals, billed for Tuesday at the same venue.Bangladesh, who conceded 23 goals and scored four goals in four matches, finished without a single point.Despite knowing that a win would take them to the semifinals, the men in red and green took to the field with a defensive strategy and kept their opponents at bay initially.The charges of Iman Gobinathan Krishnamurthy raised their hopes of even an upset victory after taking the lead against the run of play when Arshad Hossain scooped home in the 13th minute after Rashel Mahmud Jimmy stopped a fierce hit from Shohanur Rahman.But the lead lasted only for a minute as Pakistan hit back strongly with a close-range strike from Nadeem Ahmed. Since that point nothing went in favour of Bangladesh, who could not match Pakistan's pace and pressing hockey. Instead, Bangladesh's defence was exposed badly in face of crisp passing from Pakistan in the attacking third.With Bangladesh struggling to negotiate with the opposition players, Pakistan took the lead three minutes into the second quarter when Ahmed Ajaz darted into the circle from the right almost without any challenge before beating goalkeeper Biplob Khujur with a diagonal hit while Arfaz and captain Umar Bhutta netted one goal apiece in the 24th and 26th minutes to shatter Bangladesh's confidence before going to the break with a comfortable 4-1 lead.After resumption, Bangladesh came out of the sit-back strategy to launch attacks down the two flanks but were well resisted by Pakistan, who widened the margin through a penalty-corner strike from Muhammad Razzak in the 34th minute. One minute later, Bangladesh pulled one goal back with Arshad Hossain tapping in a diagonal hit from Ashraful Islam but Ajaz restored the margin again with a tap-in in the 38th minute.  The home team then collectively defended the area to keep the defeat to a reasonable margin. ",sports

""Since we played a hard match yesterday, it might have caused fatigue on our players,"" Bangladesh captain Ashraful Islam said after the match.The host nation, who lie bottom of the five-team table with zero points from three matches, still have a chance to make it to the semifinals if they manage to beat Pakistan in their last round robin match today.Pakistan, who were held to a 3-3 draw by South Korea yesterday, have two points from three matches.""Since both we and Pakistan are out of international hockey for a long time, I think we have a chance against Pakistan tomorrow. If we can play well and take our chances, we can come out with a positive result,"" Ashraful said. ""We will watch video footages of Pakistan's matches tonight and we will try to find out their weaknesses to take advantage of those in the match,"" the Bangladesh captain added.The match between Pakistan and South Korea proved to be a topsy-turvy affair.Pakistan fought back from a goal down in the first quarter to take a 2-1 lead early in the third quarter but Korea bounced back and scored two in the final quarter to take a lead. However, Pakistan scored again with three minutes remaining to salvage a point from this fixture that left them in fourth position on the table.

43,"A resolute Bangladesh surrendered an early lead to suffer a narrow 3-2 defeat to South Korea in their second match of the Hero Asian Champions Trophy at Maulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium yesterday.It was the second defeat in as many matches in the hockey tournament for the men in red and green, who have not featured in international matches since the 2018 Asian Games. And despite being on the face of adversity, the hosts fought bravely against a strong Korean side, who came into the match following a 3-3 draw against Japan and a 2-2 draw India.After a humiliating 9-0 thrashing at the hands of India in the first match, everyone expected a damage-control performance against South Korea, who had struck 23 goals in the last three meetings between two sides. However, the charges of Iman Gobinathan Krishnamurthy showed great strength in character to raise the hope of snatching a point but silly mistakes had cost them dearly.Arshad Hossain gave Bangladesh an unexpected lead in the eighth minute, tapping in a fierce hit from Fazle Rabbi, before Korea levelled the margin in the 15th minute through a penalty stroke.In the second and third quarters, Bangladesh hardly gave Korea space to unsettle the backline with debutant goalkeeper Biplob Khujur making a couple of good saves. Then the resistance finally broke down in the 47th minute with Ji Woo Cheon scoring a goal in the same manner like Arshad did earlier.An unmarked Park Cheoleon made it 3-1 in the 54th minute with a fierce hit inside the circle before Deen Mohammad Emon reduced the margin two minutes from time but could not find the equaliser from then on.""We have been viewed negatively after last match's performance, so we were determined to stick to the game plan for a better performance. The coach helped us mentally and showed how to play against Korea but we had to lose the match due to some silly mistakes,"" said goalkeeper Biplob, who was adjudged man-of-the-match.  ""It was my first international match for the senior team, so I tried to give something to the nation. The feeling is really good to be named the man of the match in the first international match"" said the Abahani goalkeeper.In the day's first match, hot-favourites India handed an emphatic 3-1 defeat to Pakistan at the same venue and kept their recent dominance intact over archrivals.Defending champions India have not only consolidated their top position in the five-team table but also kept their unbeaten run against rivals Pakistan to 12 matches in a row, which includes only a draw, while Pakistan with one point from two matches, remained winless against their perennial rivals India for last five years since their 1-0 triumph in gold-deciding match of South Asian Games in 2016.Even though the tie between India and Pakistan was deemed to be a mouth-watering battle, the high-voltage tie could hardly enthral a few hundred spectators who rather watched the erratic passing and poor finishing upfront from both sides but India had the last laugh, thanks to penalty corner conversions.From the onset, India had been fast to take control of the match through their all-out attack alongside an early lead while Pakistan banked on the counter but their individual efforts and erratic passing kept them at bay.India took a 2-0 lead within 42 minutes with strikes from Harmanpreet Singh and Akashdeep Singh before Junaid Manzoor reduced the margin in the 45th minute. Harmanpreet wrapped up the victory converting another penalty in the 53rd minute.",sports

The encounter between seven-time Olympic gold-medallist India and four-time World Cup winner Pakistan once promised a fierce battle but somehow it has turned into one-way traffic with India beating Pakistan convincingly on a few occasions in the recent past. The contest, however, still stands out due to the age-old rivalry between the two neighbouring countries.Pakistan could not beat India in the Champions Trophy since their thrilling 5-4 win in 2013.

49,"The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation is looking to turn 214 acres of Madhupur Sal Forest into an industrial park.The corporation wants to set up a fruit processing plant at Beribaid Mouja, marked by the Forest Department as part of a reserved Sal forest.The plan is to build a road, drainage system, dump yard, an effluent treatment plant, and utility lines in the forest, which according to the Mymensingh Agricultural University is home to numerous shrubs, medicinal plants, flower plants, monkeys, deer, and different species of birds.Implementing the project may cost an estimated Tk 400 crore, said immediate past chairman of the corporation Mostaque Hassan.The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) sent a letter to the Department of Environment (DoE) in Tangail on June 9, seeking to get the land on lease.Since 1925, the Sal forest has lost 80,000 acres, which is two thirds of its land due to deforestation and encroachment, according to Forest Department data.Pavel Partha, coordinator of Bangladesh Resource Centre For Indigenous Knowledge, said the Sal forest in Madhupur is dominated by trees that lose their foliage at the end of the growing season. It is the last of it's kind in Bangladesh, he said, adding that an industrial park will put its biodiversity at risk.Deforesting another 214 acres by leasing it out will violate the Forest Act-1927, National Land Use Policy, National Forest Policy and a Cabinet Division circular from 2015.Besides, Bangladesh promised to end deforestation by 2030 at the recently concluded 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland.Jahirul Haque, divisional forest officer in Tangail, said he was not aware of the BSCIC plan. ""All I can say is that it [industrial park] will not be allowed by the law. People are not even allowed to enter a reserved forest without authorisation.""Contacted, Mohammad Mojahidul Islam, deputy director at the DoE, said, ""We will make a decision after the forest department states its opinion.""In September last year, the then BSCIC chairman Mostaque Hassan visited the project site. The chairman said a detailed project plan was being made.""There are some land of the forest. If necessary, we will exempt the forestland and implement the project,"" he told The Daily Star.The land has been lying idle, he said, adding that an industrial park would create ""employment opportunities for young people"".""I talked to the agriculture minister. He promised to help us get the lease,"" he said.BSCIC operates under the Ministry of Industries and the matter in question is not directly related to the Ministry of Agriculture.Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA), said the High Court in 2018 and 2019 asked the authorities concerned to demarcate the Madhupur Sal Forest and ensure that the communities native to the region can maintain their traditional ways of living. The court also ordered protecting the biodiversity of the forest.""How could the BSCIC plan to set up an Industrial Park inside the Sal forest when the High Court clearly ordered not to use the forestland for any commercial purposes?"" she asked.WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY?In 2018, the HC ordered officials of the forest and administration to frame rules under Forest Act-1927 to ensure regeneration of Madhupur Sal Forest through plantation of indigenous species with the participation of forest-dependent people.Section-17 of the National Land Use Policy-2001 insists that such forestland should be conserved, maintained, and expanded.State Acquisition and Tenancy Act-1950 prevents forest from being leased out and declared forest land as non-retainable property.Besides, the forest department's letter of no-objection is required for the construction of any structure on land belonging to the Forest Department, said a Cabinet Division circular in 2015.In 2018, a land ministry circular requested the deputy commissioners of the district not to lease out any protected and reserved forest.",environment

Arthur Yap of Bohol province said 10 others were missing and 13 injured, and suggested the fatalities may still considerably increase with only 33 out of 48 mayors able to report back to him due to downed communications. Officials were trying to confirm a sizable number of deaths caused by landslides and extensive flooding elsewhere.In statements posted on Facebook, Yap ordered mayors in his province of more than 1.2 million people to invoke their emergency powers to secure food packs for large numbers of people along with drinking water, which he said was an urgent problem since water stations were down during power outage.After joining a military aerial survey of typhoon-ravaged towns, Yap said ""it is very clear that the damage sustained by Bohol is great and all-encompassing.""He said the initial inspection did not cover four towns, where the typhoon blew in as it rampaged on Thursday and Friday through central island provinces. The government said about 780,000 people were affected, including more than 300,000 residents who had to evacuate their homes.At least 39 other typhoon deaths were reported by the disaster-response agency and the national police. Officials on Dinagat Islands, one of the southeastern provinces first pounded by the typhoon, separately reported 10 deaths just from a few towns, bringing the overall fatalities so far to 112.President Rodrigo Duterte flew to the region Saturday and promised 2 billion pesos ($40 million) in new aid. Aides said the president will visit Bohol on Sunday.At its strongest, the typhoon packed sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 270 kph (168 mph), one of the most powerful in recent years to hit the disaster-prone archipelago, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.Floodwaters rose rapidly in Bohol's riverside town of Loboc, where residents were trapped on their roofs and trees.

It hit many of the central provinces that were pummeled last week, leaving more than 6,300 people dead in November 2013.About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year.

64,"On a November afternoon several weeks back, a middle-aged man, appearing to be a fish vendor, was spotted in Kaminiganj Bazar area of Moulvibazar's Juri upazila.But after peeking through the net covering of the bamboo basket he was carrying, over a dozen of live migratory birds were found inside, said Saddam Mia, a resident of the area, which is in close proximity to Hakaluki Haor -- one of the country's largest marsh wetlands and an Ecologically Critical Area.Hakaluki Haor is spread out across Juri, Kulaura and Barlekha upazilas of Moulvibazar, and Golapganj and Fenchuganj upazilas of Sylhet.Poaching and illegal trade of migratory birds have been on the rise in areas that surround large waterbodies such as Hakaluki Haor, as both poachers and sellers are increasingly adopting innovative and deceptive techniques to catch and sell the birds.This correspondent came across one such illegal bird seller recently in Kaminiganj Bazar, near the BGB camp. In his basket, there were 12 brownish migratory birds with long and sharp beaks, resembling common snipes. Asked, he said he bought them from hunters who caught the birds by setting traps near the haor. He said he had already sold 13 that day. The seller left the spot hastily when this correspondent started taking snaps of the birds.Several poachers as well as locals, requesting anonymity, said migratory birds are quite popular among villagers, and each bird sells between Tk 300 and 500, depending on size.Bird trader Sadek Mia said a huge number of birds visiting the haors are ensnared every day and sold to locals in surrounding areas.To attract the birds, the poachers tie down a live wild bird beside a trap in a bush in the haor area and place a digital device that continuously plays previously recorded audio of migratory birds chirping while they wait after nightfall.By midnight, a good number of the birds are trapped and later taken away by the poachers, Sadek explained.     Abdul Karim Kim, general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon's Sylhet chapter, said various species of migratory birds or wild birds from different parts of the world start arriving at the haor around winter.The number of birds in and around Hakaluki Haor has been waning in recent times, as an increased number of poachers have been using pesticide-soaked paddy to poison the birds, while many others have been catching them with traps, he added.A joint bird census -- conducted on February 24 and 25 in 43 beels of the haor -- by International Union for Conservation of Nature and Bangladesh Bird Club counted 24,551 birds belonging to 48 species.In 2020, the bird count was nearly double -- 40,126 birds belonging to 53 species.The nature and biodiversity in the haor area are under serious threat, as hunting and selling of migratory birds have been going on unabated there, primarily due to people's ignorance and greed, acknowledged Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, divisional forest officer of Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation Division in Sylhet.Illegal wildlife trade amounts to about Tk 10 crore annually in Bangladesh, forcing many of the country's wild animals and birds to go extinct, he also said.

67,"Smoke from cooking stoves that burn coal, wood, dung, and crop residues caused the deaths of almost 18,000 people in Bangladesh in 2017, according to a global study. The World Health Organisation says combustion from stoves contributes to heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and respiratory infections.In 2017, 63,718 deaths were due to ambient (outdoor) PM2.5 in Bangladesh, where residential fuel use is the single largest source for PM2.5, said the study.It said residential fuel contributed to 28.2 percent of the ambient air pollution, followed by energy with 12.4 percent.In Bangladesh, such stoves have long posed a serious danger to women, who usually shoulder the burden of cooking, according to the Health Effects Institute (HEI) study styled ""Global Burden of Disease-Major Air Pollution Sources."" The study report is scheduled to be released today.Earlier, the HEI's State of Global Air survey said particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is the sixth highest risk factor for deaths globally, accounting for nearly four million deaths in 2019.The burning of solid biofuels, such as wood for indoor heating and cooking, is a major source of PM 2.5, accounting for an additional 740,000 deaths, especially across South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the study said.The study also finds that 770,000 deaths could have been prevented if people stop using solid fossil fuels like coal.It said fossil fuel combustion, a major source of air pollution, contributed to more than one million deaths globally in 2017, more than 27 percent of all deaths from outdoor PM 2.5.The report also said coal combustion alone was responsible for half of those deaths, with natural gas and oil combustion accounting for the other half.The study team, led by Erin McDuffie and Randall Martin of Washington University in St Louis, USA, and Michael Brauer at the University of British Columbia in Canada, provide the first-ever comprehensive global analysis estimating major sources of air pollution for every country in the world.The new report noted that major sources of PM 2.5 can vary by country and region, and different parts of the world were impacted by air pollution in different ways.While fossil fuel combustion made up most of the PM 2.5 across the industrialised nations of the global north, windblown dust was a major source of PM 2.5 in African countries.Dr Pallavi Pant, senior scientist of HEI, said, ""To improve air quality across South Asia, it is important to consider the major sectors that are contributing to PM2.5 including energy production, residential cooking and heating, industries, transportation, waste etc., and design targeted measures to reduce emissions at source.""Abdus Salam, an air quality expert and a professor of the Department of Chemistry at Dhaka University, said cooking is one of the key concerns of indoor air pollution especially in rural areas as biomass is used widely.""But coal is not largely used in cooking in Bangladesh,"" he said, adding that cooking behaviour should be changed to improve the situation.He also said dust was another important PM 2.5 contributor that originated from construction activities, streets, as well as windblown particles.The HEI is an independent, non-profit research institute funded jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, industry, foundations, and development banks to provide credible, high-quality science on air pollution and health for air quality decisions.",environment

69,"Delhi shut down schools until further notice, urged people to work from home and banned non-essential trucks from entering the Indian capital due to dangerous levels of air pollution.One of the world's most polluted cities and home to some 20 million people, Delhi is cloaked every winter in a thick blanket of smog.On Saturday, the Delhi government had ordered schools to close for a week and banned construction work for four days.But in an order passed late Tuesday, the Commission for Air Quality Management for Delhi said all education institutions should remain shut until further notice.Lorries except those carrying essential goods are barred from entering the capital until November 21 and most construction activity was halted, the order said.""Anti-smog guns"" and water sprinklers were ordered to operate at hotspots at least three times a day.Six of the 11 thermal power plants within a 300-kilometre radius were told to cease operations until further notice.The commission also said that at least 50 percent of staff employed in government should work from home and encouraged those in private firms to follow suit.The order comes days after the Delhi government pushed back against a call by India's Supreme Court to declare a ""pollution lockdown"" -- a first -- which would restrict the city's population to their homes.One of the contributors to the air pollution in winter is the smoke from farmers burning their crop residue in neighbouring states.The government, however, told the Supreme Court that industry was the biggest contributor followed by vehicular pollution and dust.This week, PM 2.5 levels -- the most harmful particulate matter that is responsible for chronic lung and heart disease -- have been over 400 in several parts of the city.Last week, the levels touched 500 which is more than 30 times the maximum limit recommended by the World Health Organization.A Lancet report in 2020 said almost 17,500 people died in Delhi in 2019 because of air pollution.And a report by Swiss organisation IQAir last year found that 22 of the world's 30 most polluted cities were in India.

In Delhi, a city of nearly 20 million people, the PM2.5 reading on Friday averaged 706 micrograms, whereas the World Health Organization deems anything above an annual average of 5 micrograms as unsafe.Airborne PM2.5 can cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. And, in India, toxic air kills more than a million people annually.""The firecracker ban didn't seem to be successful in Delhi, which led to hazardous pollution levels adding on top of existing perennial sources,"" Sunil Dahiya, Analyst, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said.Every year, either government authorities or India's Supreme Court impose a ban on firecrackers. But the bans rarely appear to be enforced.Making matters worse, Diwali falls in period when farmers in the Delhi's neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana burn the stubble left after harvesting to prepare their fields for the next crop.Stubble fires accounted for up to 35% of New Delhi's PM2.5 levels, according to data from SAFAR's monitoring system, which falls under the federal Ministry of Earth SciencesA rare spell of clear skies in October due to intermittent rains and winds had helped Delhiites breathe their cleanest air in at least four years.But during winter months pollution levels surge in northern India, as lower temperatures and a drop in wind speed tend to trap pollutants in the air longer.Sick of the lack of commitment to making the capital more livable, Ambrish Mithal, a doctor at the Max HealthCare hospital in New Delhi, vented his frustration over the deteriorating AQI readings.""It's terrible for those with allergies and asthma.

The city's air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 159 around 9:15am yesterday, which is considered ""unhealthy"".Kolkata and Mumbai, cities in neighbouring India, occupied the first and third spots, respectively, with an AQI of 193 and 158.AQI between 100 and 200 is considered ""unhealthy for sensitive groups"". Similarly, 201 to 300 is said to be ""poor"", while 301 to 400 is considered ""hazardous"", posing serious health risks to residents.Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Generally, Dhaka's air starts getting fresher when monsoon rains begin in mid-June. The air remains mostly acceptable from June to October.According to experts, authorities need to chalk out a special action plan to control Dhaka's terrible dust pollution, as it turns worse every winter, particularly from November to February, posing a serious health hazard to city dwellers.During winter, the city's air quality starts deteriorating sharply due to massive discharge of pollutant particles from construction sites, rundown roads, brick kilns and other sources, they say.Ainun Nishat, professor emeritus at Brac University, said dust particles from construction sites, earth filling, black smoke from overloaded motor vehicles and traditional brick kilns located on the outskirts of Dhaka are largely responsible for making the city's air quality worse in winter.""So, all traditional brick kilns should be modernised as soon as possible,"" he said.",environment

After a long time, she is all set to make a comeback with her film this year. In a recent chat with The Daily Star, she talked about her upcoming project.We wish you a very happy birthday. How are you spending this special day?I prefer spending my birthdays all by myself. I really like it when my birthday comes since I get to see the amount of love people have for me. This is the thing that makes me happy. Currently, I am very far from Dhaka city. I am in my maternal grandparent's house which is located at Bagerhat, I have come here after a very long time. After about 10 years, I got so close to all my relatives. Considering how busy everyone's lives has become these days, we rarely get the chance to gather together. It is an amazing feeling, and I am having a good time. To be honest, when I came to Syed Mahalla, I became a little nostalgic. This place has so many bittersweet memories.It has been a long time since audience last saw you in any film.I am working in the film titled ""Paap Punno"", directed by Giasuddin Selim. I do not think I need to say anything about how amazing his work is. His film, ""Monpura"", did tremendously well. ""Paap Punno"" has a different storyline, and we did the shoot in Chandpur. I also got to work with many famous artistes. Now, the film is awaiting to be released, and I believe it will receive good responses from the audience. After ""Priotomeshu"", I am doing this project after 9 years. Is direction more difficult than acting?I feel that working as a director is a tough job. Because when I am working as an actress, my only job is to focus on being in the character I am playing. However, while working as a director, I have tons of things to think about. When and where I will place the camera, when the shoot will end, when the actors will arrive and many more things.

""Amy and I and Disney and Sony are talking about — yes, we're actively beginning to develop where the story heads next,"" said Feige, ""which I only say outright because I don't want fans to go through any separation trauma like what happened after 'Far From Home.' That will not be occurring this time.""Feige was alluding to a period between August and September of 2019, following the release of the Tom Holland-led sequel Spider-Man: Far From Home, which saw financial negotiations surrounding the future of the franchise break down between Disney and Sony. Had they not gotten back on track, Feige would have exited his involvement with the Spider-Man films, with Spider-Man himself exiting the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).Pascal subsequently noted in the New York Times interview that there is plenty of more story to explore with Tom Holland's Spider-Man, given the way in which ""No Way Home"" closes out.""At the end of the movie we just made, you see Spider-Man make a momentous decision, one that you've never seen him make before,"" she notes. ""It's a sacrifice. And that gives us a lot to work with for the next film.""However, officially, Holland is not signed on to star in any more movies at this time, even if development on a fourth Spider-Man film following ""No Way Home""  is already in its early stages.In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Holland suggested that he might step behind the camera to produce the fourth film, with a new actor as Spider-Man.

77,"There has been a sentiment amongst certain sections of people that superhero films, more specifically movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), are the ""death of cinema"". Many think pieces have been written around this concept. I think there is an inclination from a lot of people to turn their nose up at popular entertainment, and I would like to challenge them to go watch a screening of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". Watch the sheer joy this movie unfolds for an audience.Written by Chris Mckenna and Erik Sommers and directed by Jon Watts, ""No Way Home"" picks up right after Mysterio reveals Spider-Man's true identity. As Peter Parker deals with a world where people believe that they have the right to access everything that happens in the lives of famous personalities, all hell breaks loose. He does not know where to turn. With his aunt May, girlfriend MJ, and best friend Ned, he looks for ways to turn back time. Eventually, he requests Dr Strange to cast a memory wipe spell, which goes wrong. As a result, Peter starts getting visitors from other universes.Now, coming back to my timeline, Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man trilogy was my introduction to live-action superhero movies. It showed me that superheroes can be characters with genuine moral conflicts, love, and loss in their lives. Young love was treated with empathy and depth — the upside-down kiss between Peter and MJ, Peter seeing her singing ""I Am Through With Love"" at a jazz club when no one clearly understood how truly special she was, his heartbreak when she starts dating his best friend Harry — these were not just plot points for the makers to pivot the characters onto another timeline, or a crossover of some sort. They had me engrossed in the narrative.The Andrew Garfield era of Spider-Man, however, never quite sat right with me. While Garfield did an amazing job, I wish he got better scripts.Tom Holland's Spider-Man has always been an apprentice. He was very much a kid, who had extraordinary abilities but never really experienced actual conflict and pain, which make superheroes become who they are. With ""No Way Home"", this changes.From the introduction sequence itself, we see an existential crisis beginning to hit Peter. He is now truly coming of age. Although he is still a teenager, and has not yet become disillusioned, he is no longer willing to take instructions from people who are higher up in authority than him or older in age, just because he is told to.""No Way Home"" takes a stab at what it means to be a ""superhero"" — a larger than life figure with great power, and the sacrifices one has to make to keep that power. It is not just a thrilling and emotional end to Peter's high school trilogy in the MCU, but also a smart, fun, and an exciting celebration of everything there is to love about Spider-Man.This is a film that made people laugh, cry, and cheer. After the movie was over, I walked out of the hall to see crowds of people talking excitedly about what they had just seen. There wasn't one person who did not have a smile on their face. At the end of the day, isn't that what you want as a moviegoer?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is now playing in theatres. If you decide to go, stay safe, and don't forget to wear a mask.",entertainment

Another 300 people were injured among the audience of 50,000 people.Victims were trapped and hemmed in by barricades on three sides, unable to escape as thousands of fans rushed toward the stage while Scott performed. Eyewitnesses said spectators fell to the ground and some were trampled by the crowd.The medical examiner ruled out homicide, or death caused by another person, in all 10 cases.""This re-opens a fresh wound for many families who are still trying to make sense of what happened,"" said Harris County's top executive Lina Hidalgo.""Bharti Shahani suffered a horrific death as she was suffocated within a massive crowd,"" said attorney James Lassiter, who represents the Shahani family.

Marking the Victory Day of Bangladesh, ""O Buriganga Nadire"", the first single of ""Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khata"", sung by Sohini with arrangement by Samantak, was released today. Sohini is a British-Bangladeshi vocalist whose musical repertoire includes folk, modern, and traditional Bengali songs with a specialisation in Nazrul Sangeet. She has branched out into multi-lingual music in bands, for dance, and for theatre. Sohini's soaring vocals take centre stage in the soulful track, ""O Buriganga Nadire"". With heart-breaking lyrics by Subimal Bhattacherjee, the song was originally sung by noted Indian singer Amar Pal and recorded by Hindustan Records, India's oldest record label, in 1971.Sohini's rendition features Samantak on keyboard, along with Sutanu Sarkar on esraj. Her vocals were recorded by Andrew Glenn at SOAS University of London.  Sahana, who was honoured with The Bengal's Pride Award 2018 at the UK Parliament for her contribution to arts and culture, was brought up and trained in Rabindra Sangeet in Santiniketan. She had spent quite a few years in Dhaka, and is now based in London. Her rendition of the song, ""Akash Kande"" on ""Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khata"", is  arranged by Samantak with Subham Kanjilal on oud and dotara, Avirup Das Bunty on percussion, and Samantak, Subham, and Bunty on backing vocals. Having studied music production in London, Samantak is a prominent musician in West Bengal. He went to The Recording Workshop, a private institution in the UK, with the Charles Wallace Scholarship. He has collaborated as a music arranger with several noted singers. He sang and arranged a rendition of the song, ""O Mor Bangla"", on this album. The track features Prasun Bhattacharya on electric guitar, Sunny Bhattacharya on bass, and Avirup Das Bunty on percussion. ""Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khata"", featuring three tracks, is the dream project of two London-based academics, Somnath Batabyal and Georgie Pope, who both work at SOAS University of London, renowned for its research expertise on the Global South. Somnath has his roots in Dhaka's Gandaria, while Georgie, from the UK, is a musician and an ethnomusicologist, who has been researching the music of Bengal and Assam for the past decade. They are the executive producers of this collaborative album, for which all the tracks are recorded, mixed, and mastered by Alok Chowdhury.""In the summer of 2018, I was sitting with Sahana on the balcony of her house in Santiniketan, where both of us were listening to bird songs. We started talking about what it means to be a Bengali in foreign lands, and what binds us together. Our collective response was, it is music and poetry, and the particular sounds of childhood we carry with us. It was at this moment that the idea for the album was born. The 50th anniversary of the birth of Bangladesh was approaching, and it seemed to be an opportune moment to rejoice in both the struggle and the promise of that time through music,"" says Somnath. ""We are all children of 1971. We have grown up in the shadows and the possibilities of what Bangladesh promised. Collectively, we wanted to hand this treasure to a younger generation.""Through Sahana, the producers were introduced to Sovan Saha, Director, Inreco Entertainment. Hindustan Records is a part of Inreco Entertainment. Producing music since the 1930s, their first recording was the voice of Kobi Guru Rabindranath Tagore. Sovan Saha is the custodian of an extraordinary collection of recordings that he made during 1971 with artistes such as Amar Pal. ""Artistes from both sides of the border collaborated with each other to sing songs for Hindustan Records during Bangladesh's Liberation War. Our album features reimaginings of three such songs from 1971,"" says Sahana. ""We wanted to commemorate the fact that Bangladeshi and Indian singers came together fifty years ago, to sing for Bangladesh's independence. I hope to always be a part of Bangladesh."" ""When he heard of the venture, Sovan Saha was excited and generously opened up his archive for our use. It has been an incredible joy listening to the old recordings and seeing the brilliant creative ideas that Sahana, Samantak, and Sohini have brought to each song,"" mentions Georgie. ""Somnath and I were thinking about a name for the album. We wanted something that would speak to migration and allow the imagination to transcend man-made cartography. Doyel Pakhi is the national bird of Bangladesh and we imagined the songs that the bird would have sung of those days. So, we came up with 'Doyel Pakhir Ganer Khatha' - and, even in translation - 'The Magpie-Robin's Songbook' - it carried the melody.""After ""O Buriganga Nadire"", ""Akash Kande"" will be released on December 25, 2021, and ""O Mor Bangla Re"" will be out on January 1, 2022.

During the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, she alongside her family were forced to flee to India, as their home in Raozan, Chattogram was completely destroyed.She was one of the witnesses of the uplifting of the flag of Bangladesh at the Pakistan high commission on December 6 for the first time in history, after Indira Gandhi recognised Bangladesh as a nation. The Daily Star caught up with the artiste to listen to the memories of those days.""Within just a few days of the beginning of the war, Chattogram was under attack. On the midnight of April 28, when we wee already robbed and in the same clothes for ten days, our village home was destroyed.Finding no other way, we started walking towards Betbunia hill in Rangamati, and walked 85 Kilometers in just two days. I was with my 75-year-old Thakuma (grandmother), my Kakima (aunt) who was eight months pregnant, and 36 other family members with three hundred people from our village. We did not have any food with us. However, we then crossed the Subroon border and reached Agartola. From there, we went to Kolkata by train.In May, artiste Swapan Chowdhury informed us that they have formed an association 'Mukti Sangrami Shilpi Sangstha' with Sanjida Khatun, Wahidul Haque along with Mahmuduzzaman Benu, and Debabrata Chowdhury among others. We were invited to join them. After that, we went to 144 Lenin Sarani, which was made the office for practice and rehearsals.Noted intellectuals of Kolkata like Nirendranath Chakraborty, Dipendranath Bandyopadhyay, Debesh Ray, Shankha Ghosh, Proshun Basu, and Amitabh Dasgupta supported us dearly, and they were in the committee as well.While Dalia Noushin, Sharmin Morshed, Rafiqul islam, Kalyani Ghosh, along with Tareq Ali, Enamul Haque, Syed Hasan Imam, Shahin Samad, and Shila Momen were the members of 'Muktir Gaan'.The association decided to hold a fundraising concert for the artistes to create awareness. We decided present ""Rupantorer Gaan"" on stage which was written by Shahriar Kabir, and narrated by Syed Hasan Imam on July 3 at Rabindra Sadan.The aim was to outline history based on the song. The task was not at all easy in the context of contemporary politics. It highlighted the struggles of 1952 to 1971. Mustafa Monowar designed the entire set.On July 4, all of the noted artistes of Kolkata including Aparna Sen, Shambhu Mitra, Tripti Mitra, Debabrata Biswas, Kanika Banerjee, Ashoketaru Bandhyopadhyay, Nilima Sen and Suchitra Mitra among others performed in the fund raising event, where we sang the chorus.During the war, we went to the camps located at the borders, to meet and sing for the war refugees to boost their confidence. We would cover two to three camps every day. The aged people would cry their hearts out, and they would want us to spend more time with us. We would also cover Muktijoddha camps, and they would never let us go without having lunch with them.On the morning of December 6, we were informed that India has recognised Bangladesh as a free nation, and that our national flag will be raised at the high commission. The artistes of 'Mukti Sangrami Shilpi Sangstha' were called to sing the national anthem, ""Amar Shonar Bangla"". We all attended the event with tears of joy. At that time, radio Akashbani Kolkata was flaring with ""Shono ekti Mujiborer Theke Lokkho Mujiborer Konthoshorer Dhoni"" on Angshuman Ray's voice.We came back to Bangladesh in the second week of February, 1972, almost after nine months.The memory is still fresh in my mind, and the emotion cannot be expressed in words.""",entertainment

This exhibition is a part of the global campaign, ''16 Days of Activism against Gender-based violence''. The campaign further included a series of virtual discussions, other exhibitions, awareness-raising workshops, and a cultural programme.The artworks on display explore the artist's own self, her home, and her country. They are somewhat inspired by the ideas of American philosopher George Hubert Mead. Jannat has beautifully incorporated the concept of self and emergence as her artworks depict what she feels, how she feels, her own senses, and her emotions expressed from her own perspectives.""My father always emphasised on the idea that the home in my native village would feel different. Growing up, I could relate to what he said, in my own home. This was the beginning of my exploration into native forms, colours, and history, while rediscovering the identity I truly belong to,"" she explained.Jannat also focused on the importance of incorporating traditional art forms in her current work. Most of the artworks on display feature birds, fishes and traditional motifs within incomplete human figures. Some of the works are also inspired by rickshaw art and nakshi katha designs. She has mixed Earth colours with acrylics to create a different style featuring Chinese strokes on paper.The idea behind this exhibition stemmed from her Master's project about identifying oneself. ""The series has been shaped by my everyday experiences and is all about getting back to my roots,"" she added. She began working on the ongoing series during the pandemic. ""I think the biggest takeaway from this exhibition is the story behind each artwork and how the audience decides to interpret it,"" she asserted.Jannat has always been fascinated by cultural heritage, and attempts to reminisce our history through her work. ""Some traditional motifs are already lost and resources were greatly limited during the pandemic. My faculty members were helpful in helping me find these connections and in the future I want to reach out to people who work with these artforms so I can present their stories in a better way,"" she concluded. The exhibition is open to visitors till December 18.",entertainment

100,"Transforming a house to a home can be challenging. A home's atmosphere should be light-hearted, vibrant, welcoming, and creative. In the quest for the ideal home environment, décor plays a crucial role in expressing personality, bringing in a sense of cosiness and comfort, and harmony in each room.Candles fit into almost every style of surroundings and can be used as beautiful decor to make a house livelier, relaxing and therapeutic for down time. With both scented and unscented candles, the ambience which candles bring in allows the light and smells to impact mood, offer well-being, and create a more personal atmosphere in the practice of various self-care rituals.Coming in various shapes like circular, cylindrical, round, patterns, and also in varying sizes, and packaging, candles can be a luxurious and sophisticated object to integrate into the home's decoration. Many shops like Aarong and Miniso, and online marketplaces like Metaphor, Aura, Candle Cup BD and Newton's Archive offer elegant and sophisticated fragrances, perfect to leave scattered throughout the house and to amplify a relaxing and heart-warming environment. These candles range in designs and sizes, with an aesthetic appeal fitting for every room and mood. Starting from fruity fragrances to floral and sandalwood to natural scents to aromatic and therapeutic ones, there is a scent and design for every purpose.There are multiple ways candles can be used as decorative pieces. Be it as ornamental pieces on their own or as complements to other decorations like paintings, vases, lamps, sculptures, and so on, candles are multidimensional. Candles also come in different colours. For minimalist households, candles reflecting gentle light and neutral hues can be used to add a more personalised and sophisticated touch. On the other hand, using colourful, unusual colours and moulds for a more upbeat style helps maintain the vibrant and active essence of a room.Perhaps the most common association with candles is the dining room and candle-lit dinners. Whether formal or casual, candles can make the dining room feel more pleasant and complete. Unscented candles are ideal for the dining room as different scents (the candles and the food) drifting in the air might not be appetising while having a meal. Taller or cylindrical candlesticks or tall candle holders among some foliage creates a finer and more refined effect. Some smaller yet captivating candle designs might make for an attractive centrepiece with it being too extravagant or over-the-top. Candles can also help in relaxing and unwinding. For instance, the living room should exude a relaxing, friendly, and inviting atmosphere at any given time of day. During the day, fresh scented candles can bring positive energy, while at night, burning candles in the living room can create a warm, relaxing and inviting atmosphere. For a more unique touch, candle wall sconces can be used instead of room lights, or a vast variety of candles can be placed in distinct corners, coffee tables or on top of books to create a gently lit and comforting space.Placing candles in the bathroom can create the illusion of a spa, and add a fresh, clean aroma to the bathroom. To create this spa-like atmosphere, scattering candles of various sizes around the bathtub or placing fresh scented candles on the counter near the sink, would make for a worthwhile relaxation. To generate more serenity, white candles, or coloured candles, can be used to brighten up a neutral coloured environment. However, before the relaxing can actually begin, make sure there is nothing flammable nearby!The lovely smell that permeates across the room when the scented and aromatised candle burns, has a relaxing effect, allowing one to reconnect with themselves without haste. Aromatherapy can create a pleasant workplace by providing a sensory experience. Using not only scented candles but also essential oils like lavender, sandalwood, citronella, rosemary, and lemongrass, can help one focus and improve their overall well-being both physically and psychologically. All these elements combined (diffusers, vaporisers, scented candles and essential oils) contribute to a greater sense of tranquillity and lightness.Candles can be used to complete the decor of a home, create a peaceful ambiance after a long day or for meditation, yoga, eating delectable food, reading your favourite book, listening to music, having friends over for dinner, or simply turning off the lights and being with your thoughts. With all its purposes, candles are a small touch but with a big impact.",life_living

Although it might seem as if the only way you can include them in your interior is through vases, that does not have to be the case.Restrained and framed Dried or pressed flowers can be incorporated into wall decor in numerous ways, be it through frames, garlands or wreaths. If you would like to adorn your wall with flowers in a more restrained way without taking up too much space, try pressing flowers with a heavy book and parchment paper before framing it. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.  When you choose flowers for your pressed arrangement, make sure to include a few vibrant focal flowers for the centre, supplemented with some muted filler flowers and leaves for balance. If you want it to be dainty, go for one sole flower. To ease the pressing process, opt for flowers with flat buds only. It is best to pick or buy flowers which are blooming to reduce the amount of colour drained during the pressing process. After you let the flowers dry for a few weeks between the pages of a heavy book and parchment paper, they will be ready to be framed.

If you look forward to spring every year, you can incorporate dried pastel flowers such as roses or lavender.  If you find warm colours associated with autumn comforting, try dried strawflowers and sunflowers for your wreath. If wreaths feel too over the top for you, substitute with dried flower garlands.

103,"There is no success without sacrifice. Victory minus struggle. Fifty years have now passed since that glorious day in December 1971 when we achieved victory after a battle for nine months. The sacrifices made during those days of war will forever remain irreplaceable losses for our nation.One can never stand on the ground without firmly holding on the roots. That is one lesson from history we have learned. And, unfortunate it may seem that despite all the exercise involving the preservation of the history of the liberation movement, we have failed to address the issue widely to the younger generation. How we may bring the topic of liberation war to those born decades later is a matter of deep concern, but it has to be done!The Liberation War of 1971 was a people's struggle. Battles were fought at the frontiers, and war raged in the most unthinkable of places. People wholeheartedly supported the freedom movement, sans a few individuals who opposed the spirit of liberation; some abetted and engaged in war crimes.   Those who were witness to the momentous moments of this nation's history, those who took part in the war — freedom fighters — are now among the elderly. Many we have lost, yet their endeavours remain etched in time.While historians embark in their effort to preserving the past. It can be said without an iota of doubt that one must nurture a 'historian' within every individual, especially the younger generation. And perhaps the best way of doing so is through story-telling.Every person witness to the War has unique narratives — some of gallantry, others of sorrow, and loss. Some stories are just trivial matters of everyday lives, yet set in the context, they emerge as an important tool in understanding the past. We must preserve these stories and one of the ways of doing so is perhaps by presenting the human angle to the liberation movement.It will take time for a generation who did not witness the War to come to terms with it as the barriers of time are separating us further still. The practice of transmitting history must remain as a continuous effort and not limited to days of special significances.Many of us grew up listening to the stories of our grandparents, our fathers, mothers, and uncles and aunts. They were not necessarily stories of the freedom movement; perhaps the time has come to make a conscious effort to make our stories relate to the liberation struggle.It is not an easy task, but once stories are absorbed in their spirit, those willing to embark on an academic pursuit can do so on their own. It would be wrong to expect every new individual to become an expert of the War, but it is essential that every individual becomes a treasure trove of stories to pass on to the next generation, not as a history lesson, but a part of our past.",life_living
104,"A weekend-long extravaganza that was the ultimate medley of song, celebration and fashion, the Bangladesh Couture Week 2021 championed the majesty of Bangladeshi silk in all its forms and glory. Taking place at Edge Gallery of Gulshan North Avenue, the fashion exhibit was a successful instalment and courtesy of the Fashion Design Council of Bangladesh (FDCB) who pieced together the event for the sole purpose of bringing the regal sophistication of a mesh of silk to the fore.The inauguration of the exhibit was carried out by chief guest Dr Dipu Moni, Minister of Education of Bangladesh. In her own words, ""Handloom fabric such as silk, jamdani and muslin are the insignias of Bangladesh, it's what we are known for to the rest of the world. Our honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is the greatest brand ambassador of the traditional clothes and fabrics of Bengal. I laud FDCB's attempt in reviving heritage fabrics through fantastic exhibits like this one which has been dedicated to silk and the government is also playing its part in preserving our traditional crafts and history.""Joining her as another esteemed guest at the exhibit was the Japanese ambassador to Bangladesh Naoki Ito who remained much appreciative of Bangladesh's diverse culture and the FDCB's noble efforts.At the heart of this exhibit that ran between 2nd to 4th December, 17 designers of the fashion council envisioned 17 different concepts and weaved stunning creations, any one of which can easily be housed in a museum. Afsana Ferdousi, for example, glamourized Bengali folk tales of Bon Bibi- the protector goddess of the Sundarbans and 'sheetal pati.' She does so by taking the blooms of Bangladesh's six seasons and expressing them in bold prints against subdued backgrounds that are anything but minimal. Make it all statement was her endgame, a sartorial ideology adopted by many of the other fashion designers as well.Considering Farah Anjum Bari's creations, the designer is an inspired soul who pours her concept of creating oceanic ripples onto beds of organza. Sequins sown in waves give you the illusion of a warm summer day by the sea, standing by the shores, completely mesmerised by how the water catches the sunlight. Farah Anjum Bari's clothes are nostalgic, her designs the epitome of grace.Shahrukh Amin, the debonair designer of the FDCB, was another designer to watch with his posies of flowers stitched strategically onto his masterpieces. Sarah Karim, with her poise and acumen takes the darkness of the timeless black and contrasts it with the pristineness of white to design fascinating cuts and clothes that are the sartorial equivalent of the boho diva.Maheen Khan also shows us a few tricks from her sleeve in her works of art as she reimagines the traditional drape and cut of a Bengali's belle's ultimate garb, the sari. Khan deconstructs the humble blouse and incorporates cropped jackets to make it a two-step wear. She puts an interesting spin on her designs with symmetrical pleats and monochrome colours and drapes the folds of a sari in a much looser, almost hippie style.More artistic designers who took part in the exhibit were Chandana Dewan, Faiza Ahmed, Shaibal Saha, Farzana Nova, Tasfia Ahmed, Sadia Rashid Chowdhury, Rifat Rahman, Rupo Shams, Rima Naaz, Lipi Khandker, Nawshin Khair and, finally, Emdad Hoque — all with their spectacular creations.Bangladesh Couture Week 2021 also took the time to honour 11 celebrities for their charismatic personalities, dedication to style and for being true icons in their own ways.

105,"On Sunday, 12 December in the resort city of Eliat, Israel with 80 women from around the world competing for the crown, Miss India — Harnaaz Sandhu was crowned Miss Universe 2021. Nadia Ferreira of Paraguay and Lalela Mswane of South Africa were the first and second runners-up respectively.Sandhu, a 21-year-old hailing from Punjab and representing India at the 70th Miss Universe Pageant brought back to India the same crown 21 years after Lara Dutta's win in 2000. So far, India has had three Miss Universe Crown winners, the first being Sushmita Sen in 1994.Apart from winning the crown, Sandhu has also starred in few Punjabi films such as 'Yaara Diyan Poo Baran' and 'Bai Ji Kuttange.' Highly inspired by her mother who is a gynaecologist, Sandhu believes strongly in women empowerment and is a strong supporter of women's constitutional rights to education, career, and freedom of choice.Her winning attire is said to be dreamy, rosy-pink lehenga by Abhinav Mishra, aptly paired with a matching umbrella. According to the designer, the entire look was meant to be a visual representation of an Indian Queen, who is equally graceful and strong, nurturing and loving, fierce and bold in all aspects of her life. Both the attire and the matching umbrella were covered in mirrors and embroidery. Upon winning Sandhu took to social media and expressed that she felt 'a sense of empowerment' while wearing the outfit.The concluding 'winning-answer' was to a question asked to all of the final three contestants – What advice would you give to young women watching, on how to deal with the pressures that they face today? Sandhu gave a fitting reply that mostly referred to increasing self-confidence and individuality amongst the youngsters. The answer seemed to have convinced the judges enough to declare her the winner of the occasion.Celebrated comedian, Steve Harvey, hosted the competition. After Sandhu's win was announced, she celebrated with other contestants' on stage, shouting to a camera, ""Chak de Phatte, India,"" a Punjabi exclamation stating, ""Let's do this, India!""",life_living
106,"Believe it or not, it is possible to get that enviable skin at any age. By incorporating just a few simple habits into your daily routine, you can get clearer, spotless and more youthful skin, with results visible in as little as four weeks. By now, we know all about UV rays and the kind of serious damage it can do to our skin. Therefore, when it comes to sunscreen, there can be no skimping. However, where sunscreen protects you against tanning and premature ageing, it does nothing for the dark spots that occur on your skin as a result of glycation. The process of glycation occurs when too much sugar and too much protein in your diet combines with body heat. Without going too much into the chemistry of it, let it suffice to say that the less sugar you use in your diet, the better your skin will feel and look. By reducing sugar from the above trio, the process of glycation can be reversed, diminishing and then completely wiping out dark spots, wrinkles, the effects of collagen loss and sag from your skin, giving you clear, blemish-free, lifted skin that automatically looks two decades younger. Completely eliminating sugar from our diet is a difficult ask — sugar is tasty and frankly, everywhere. So, what if we told you that there is another way to achieve the same results without altering the sugar level in our diet? Introducing: polyphenols! Polyphenols are some of the most powerful antioxidants found in plants and by harnessing the power of this super molecule, whether in consumption or usage, it is possible to curb the signs of early ageing. Coffee and green tea contain polyphenols, as do nuts, olives and berries. You can use moisturisers and skin serums that contain polyphenols too so that they work their magic from the outside. The stresses of modern life can suck the life out of our health and more often than not, what goes on under the skin is what shows up on the skin. Just some simple healthy habits boost skin health and when skin is presented with the right nutrients, it thanks you in amazing ways. Give it a go.",life_living
107,"In a fast-paced, materialistic era as such, taking it slow may in fact be better for the world. With this philosophy at its core, Friendship Colours of the Chars celebrated ""A Night of Tradition"" that magnificently interweaved tradition and fashion on Friday, November 26, at Le Meridien, Dhaka.Star Lifestyle was one of the media partners of the event.Friendship Colours of the Chars is a social enterprise of Friendship NGO that works with marginalized women residing in the remotest areas of Bangladesh within the riverine islands. By providing them with vocational training to master the art of handloom, natural dying, block printing, and embroidery, they are empowered to live life with dignity while preserving the culture and tradition of our country, all in an effort to promote slow and sustainable fashion.A Night of Tradition began with opening remarks from Nazra Mahjabeen Sabet, Director of Operations, Nodi Limited, who stated, ""We all have a common goal of making our world a better place with better systems. Friendship Colours of the Chars is the first slow and sustainable fashion brand in Bangladesh formed to promote slow fashion in a fast-moving world, while respecting the history and heritage of old Bengal.""Runa Khan, Founder and Executive Director of Friendship NGO, added, ""The poor cannot afford poor solutions. They need to identify with something beautiful to find the courage to face challenges life throws at them and live with dignity. Our focus remained on providing these people with access to health, education, and income and eventually, Friendship Colours of the Chars was born.""Providing a synopsis of the life of a weaver, the first performance was a poetry recitation synchronised with a performance depicting rural life. The minimalistic garments featured in soothing shades of white perfectly drew the image of the simple and ordinary lives of people living in remote regions of Bangladesh – peaceful and tranquil with no hustle and bustle.The fashion walks emphasised on six broad categories, the first of which was the most traditional of human power tools – handloom. Following eco-friendly procedures, all fabric is a product of this traditional technique combined with manual dexterity and skills of the weavers.Each roll of yarn not only weaves wearable clothing but also the stories of the women behind their making. The simplicity of the attires in pale colours was indeed a reflection of the purity and modesty that lies behind their creation.The second fashion line represented the finest handmade creation of Bangladeshi tradition – Jamdani. The articles of clothing donned in the runway not only captured the regal features of Jamdani but also encapsulated decades of rich history. They are made from the purest of cotton replete with a mix of complex patterns consisting of geometric, plant, and floral motifs.Friendship Colours of the Chars tailors not just traditional saris handed down to us from the past but also modern ready wear for the present, which was the theme for the next fashion walk. As the models strutted down the runway in attires that are up-to-the-minute chic yet made using traditional methods, popular singer Mehreen Mahmud added fervour to the event with her energetic performance.Also present in the event was Afsana Mimi, actress and director of Shilpakala Academy who graciously emphasised on the value of love, respect, and pride that is involved in the making of these articles of clothing, jewellery, and accessories.Pure Bengal silk is a reflection of the silky rivers flowing throughout our country and the next fashion line paid tribute to this fabric. Adorning unique designs, wax prints, block prints, patterns, and embroidery, it demonstrated a sublime blend of slow fashion and contemporary style entwined with sheer elegance.Following this, the aura of the event turned cool as it focused on one colour of the rainbow – indigo. Indigo dyeing is one of the purest forms of natural dye and is etched in our history that dates centuries back. The mix and match of outfits that ranged from traditional to modern not only represented slow fashion, but history wrapped in blue hues.Friendship Colours of the Chars is spreading its reach across the globe to Europe, representing the infusion of Bangladeshi heritage and slow fashion in foreign lands. Their store in Luxembourg is the flagship retail outlet that adapts to trending global styles, where the shopping space reflects our culture.Marc Elvinger, Co-Chair of Friendship International regarded it ""as the most beautiful shop in town"" accentuating the fine collection of popping colours and quality attires. The last performance of the evening provided a synopsis of modish attires that are exported to Europe, straight from the chars.  The show ended with the gracious presence of Imam Hassan, the Lead Designer behind the attires for the evening and concluding remarks from esteemed Fashion Designer Chandra Shekhar Saha, who noted, ""Fashion is dynamic, that is altering with dignity, colour, perception, creativity, ideas, and innovation. But slow fashion pulls us back to reality and reminds us that we are in fact very close to nature.""A Night of Tradition was a celebration of our pride and heritage along with the rise of slow fashion in Bangladesh. It brought under limelight the work of unsung heroes, the women of the chars who use these skills to stitch their own passion and compassion into beautiful hand-woven fabric, defining what it means by slow and sustainable fashion in its rawest form.

108,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looked elated as he welcomed all to this year's British Curry Awards, known as the Oscars for the global curry industry, held at the Battersea Evolution Center, London. On this star-studded event organised by the British-Bangladeshi entrepreneur Enam Ali MBE in association with Just Eat, Boris Johnson in a video message said, ""The global recognition of those talented people of the curry industry is truly mind-blowing. Even more gratifying is the fact that in the last two years, in the midst of the most difficult days of the nation, these people selflessly and persistently provided foods to our NHS and to people from door to doors saving millions of invaluable lives"".Welcoming all corners to the gala event that two decades back actually began in the hands of some notable British-Bangladeshi entrepreneurs, who do control the best part of the British curry industry, and has today become one of the national festivals in Britain, the British Prime Minister expressed his heartfelt thanks and felicitations to all the restaurateurs, chefs and waiters working for the industry.Nominated by people, best of the restaurateurs from all over Britain flocked to the capital city with a dream for winning the 'Curry Oscar' a jewel in the crown at the most rousing festival of the year. To add to the splendour of the event, celebrities from sports, entertainment, culture, and politics made their presence.The organisers of the festival dedicated the entire festival to the memory of the pioneers, businessmen and workers of the British curry industry who lost their lives during the difficult COVID-19 pandemic in the last one and a half years.   Notably, more than 90 per cent of the British curry industry, else known as the Asian and Indian curry industry spread across the UK, was created by the Bangladeshi entrepreneurs. Although Bangladeshi restaurants won most of the awards in the previous year, this year out of 12 categories, they bagged four, while two went to Pakistani and the rest to Indian restaurants.British Curry Awards 2021 Winners are —Best Restaurant Scotland: Dishoom, North East: Mumtaz Restaurant, North West: Asha's, East Midlands: Montaz Newmarket, West Midlands: Pushkar Restaurant, Wales: Purple Poppadom, South East: Chez Mumtaz, South West: Prithvi Restaurant, London Central and City: Benares, London– Outer & Suburbs: Shampan Bromley, Best Newcomer: Mathura Restaurant, Best Delivery Restaurant/Takeaway: Maliks Express Kitchen and Most Innovative Restaurant Concept: Khai Khai Indian Restaurant.",life_living
109,"Rarely does anyone say no to kebabs. Whether it is the traditional version or the taste of a foreign cuisine, we all love the taste of spicy charred meat on pita bread every now and then. So, what makes Amish the answer to our kebab cravings? Glad you asked.Amish is perfect for takeaways and/or gathering of a small group. Although we have accepted kebab shops to look a bit messy and greasy, Amish proves us wrong. With a polished look inside out, it wipes off any hygiene question you may have by offering a live kitchen experience. The kebab meat is carved off of a circulating heated cylinder and assembled right before your eyes.Next notable fact is the menu itself. Again with a very refined look, Amish offers a limited number of options with only the best of their creation; quality over quantity.Kebabs are available in both chicken and beef variants, and you may choose to have it as a wrap or between sub-breads. You can also choose to adjust the spice level. Chips and meat, on the other hand, is doner with a poutine twist to it. This dish is loaded with the meat of your choice along with fries and house-special sauce. Sounds like love in a box, doesn't it?Last but not the least, Amish has probiotic yoghurt drinks as the perfect complement to your meal.In conversation with one of the owners, Faisal Khan, we got to know the story behind the beginning of Amish. It turns out that in 2020, this close-knit group of friends came up with an investment plan that would require their involvement and keep them together.""We are all busy with our lives and with time, people are bound to grow apart. Amish came as an attempt to keep us all together,"" he said, and added, ""I hope I don't scare you, but Amish is actually owned by 18 people.""The atmosphere around Amish seems to reflect the vibe it was created from. You can catch up with a friend, stop for a quick meal on the go, or just unwind by yourself at the end of the day. This is probably why despite being relatively new, it is growing in popularity rather fast.With the winter approaching soon, make sure you don't miss out on the 'meatiest doner kebabs in town.'Essentials —Location: Shop No. #2 [Ground Floor] Army Market, ECB Chattar, Manikdi, Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka-1206Phone:01321-159000Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/amishproteenPhoto: Amish",life_living
110,"With approximately 296 restaurants on board, Munchies is the first delivery service offering to serve all night long – from 8PM to 6AM! Not only does it deliver after hours, the options available at Munchies is not subject to any area-wise distance. No matter what part of the city you reside in, if you order you will be served.Anit Kumar Das, Nafisa Anjum Apala and Tamim Mridha are well-recognised names in their own respective fields who came together to form Munchies. Their first delivery initiative was called 'Now' that worked to transport emergency items to people during the initial months of lockdown in 2020.Within the next few months, they extended their services from essentials to food, and launched 'Munchies' in January 2021. A valid question here is, ""Do we really need another food delivery service?"" Apparently we do, and Munchies showed us why.In our country, the concept of ordering food and groceries online was first introduced in 2013, and has almost completely changed our shopping experience. Following its success, many companies entered the market and it quickly became rather competitive.However, these conventional delivery services do not operate during late hours of the night, and well, our food cravings do not work by the clock. Munchies basically presents itself as the one-stop solution for all the night owls, sudden cravings, unexpected guests, or some urgent requirements.Putting this unique idea into work could not have been easy. Luckily, we were able to hear a little about this journey from one of the three founders, Anit Kumar Das.""Doubts were definitely there. With no previous data to rely on, we knew Munchies could be a hit or miss. But we eventually decided to go for it."" said Das.""There were quite a few challenges in the beginning. First was the fact that mainstream restaurants do not operate at night. So it took a great deal of convincing to get them to agree. Also due to the ongoing pandemic, many restaurants were suffering from losses. Collaborating with us also worked in their favour."" Since delivery services do not work at night, riders of Munchies also have to face several check posts around the city.Munchies is probably one of the most user-friendly websites you can come across. In the restaurant section, you will find food categorised according to the cuisine and not just by name. This makes choosing and comparing a lot easier. The 'safety and hygiene' section stocks generous varieties of surgical masks, gloves, sanitisers and several items of personal hygiene. The best part is you can order from more than one section at the same time. So, antacid can accompany your biriyani next time.Other than this, you will also find snacks, beverages, ice cream, instant and frozen items, etc. Munchies helpline is highly responsive and has been able to help many of its customers in need.Das recalled one such incident when talking to us. ""We got a call asking if we could deliver some prescribed medicine. The caller's mother had fallen ill but they were unable to access any pharmacy at the moment. We asked them to send the prescription to us or our rider and once they did, we got it from a shop nearby."" Another time, they were able to deliver sanitary napkin to a girl in a similar situation. ""It is times like these and the warm feedback of our customers that has allowed us to grow as much as we have within such a short period of time,"" he added.

111,"""Food, especially good food, brings people together. The Mediterranean diet and the Italian tradition include the notion of eating together and spending quality time with family and friends,"" the ambassador said. ""And this is also what we have done on this event, by bringing people from various international, local, and business communities together.""And hence, the residence became a vibrant and lively place, with laughter and cheers and friends catching up, with the lawn hosting a number of stalls where cooks (mostly people from the Italian community in Bangladesh), made and presented the guests with delicacies of the country — from pizza and risotto to gnocchi (often referred to as Italian dumpling) and cotolette di melanzane (eggplant cutlets) and bagna cauda (a dip that is often served with vegetables).In the heart of it all is of course Mediterranean diet, which is recognised by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, along with the art of Neapolitan 'Pizzaiuolo', the traditional culinary art of the preparation and the baking of the dough.Beatrice Kaldun, head of the office and UNESCO representative to Bangladesh, was also present during this event and spoke of these heritages in her speech.The Daily Star was one of the media partners of the event. Mediterranean diet promotes healthy eating and healthy living. It is a broader concept than people sometimes make it to be. It is a heritage, comprising of various skills, rituals, traditions, etc. related to not just the production and cooking of food, but also the sharing and consumption of food. As for the choice of the food items, it places a lot of emphasis foods like fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, fish, and olive oil. Consumption of dairy and meat products is also there, but in relatively smaller extents. Hence, the Mediterranean diet is often regarded as a healthy diet and lifestyle, nourishing not just the body with nutritious food, but also the mind, with the concept of eating together and strengthening community and family bonding.This year the theme of World Week of Italian Cuisine was 'tradition and perspectives of Italian cuisine: awareness and enhancement of food sustainability'. The theme involves, among other things, a wide range of issues related to biodiversity, food diversity, biosphere reserves, and sustainable agricultural practices.The Week also raised awareness against the Nutri-Score system of labelling on food packaging, which categorises food products on a five-colour scale according to their calculated nutritional scores. It has been argued that this system may provide a vague and distorted image of many Mediterranean foods which are generally considered to be very healthy.""Extra virgin olive oil, which has many health benefits, has been deemed as being rather unhealthy (due to its fat content),"" ambassador Enrico Nunziata exemplified. ""Now of course, if you are using it for frying in large quantities every day, it is bad. It really depends on how you are using it and how much you are consuming, but a direct negative label does not take into account all that and may negatively influence consumers in their purchases.""Be it issues like food sustainability and biodiversity, or the debate of the aforementioned food labelling, or the protection of intangible cultural heritages, the World Week of Italian Cuisine tackled them all.And the food fiesta at the ambassador's residence had been a medium to bring forward these conversations, in the most delightful and charming manner, with the help of delicious food and celebrations of the Mediterranean diet and Italian cuisine.

113,"Baking is often therapeutic. Dare I say, bread baking is also addictive! Those who have tried their hand in bread baking can surely resonate with the above statements. As for those who have not, I suggest you give it a go. Even if a kitchen fail occurs, rest assured the procedure would at least calm your mind. The entire process of bread baking is so beautiful, and although it may take several hours to make at home, the result is worth it as there is no aroma better than the smell of freshly baked goodies in my accord! For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.  There is something utterly satisfying about kneading the soft dough and giving it time to rest for as long as it requires, then finally watching it rise beautifully in the oven — a true labour of love. Fear not, because time is the only complex element in this elaborate process. Bread also happens to be a quintessential staple all over the world, and thus, several countries have their own type of breads that are representatives of the country. Thus, here are four bread recipes handpicked from around the world for you to savour. ITALIAN CIABATTA This soft and tender bread is infamous for being hard to make at home. If you think likewise and the thought of baking ciabatta at home intimidates you, then this recipe shall be your ultimate saviour! It requires only a handful of pantry ingredients and if followed correctly, you shall master the art of bread baking in no time. Originating in Italy, ciabatta is best enjoyed with a drizzle of pure extra virgin olive oil, a light sprinkling of salt and freshly sliced tomatoes. To enhance the flavour even further, you can rub a slice of garlic on the slices of bread. Ciabatta also makes a great base for bruschetta or crostini topped with juicy tomatoes, olives, and basil.                Ingredients 2½ cups bread flour 2 tsp instant yeast 1 tsp salt 3 tbsp olive oil 1¼ cup lukewarm water Method Drop the yeast in one cup of water and leave it for 10 minutes in order to activate. In a large bowl, add flour, salt, and a couple tablespoons of olive oil and mix to combine. Add in the yeast and water mixture into the bowl and start stirring everything with a wooden spoon. As the dough comes together, start mixing with your hands. This tends to be very sticky so you may oil your palms. Add the remaining water in little amounts as you go. Stretch the dough, drop it back and then push it against you with the help of your palm. Be careful about not tearing the dough and continue kneading for 8–10 minutes.  Once done, the dough should be incredibly light and soft. Slip in the prepared dough into a greased bowl. Cover this and leave it to proof for two hours in a warm place. After two hours, the dough should triple in size. Place the dough on a floured surface and lightly stretch it to a slender rectangle. Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise and cover it again for 15 minutes. At this point, preheat your oven at 170°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Gently place the slices of dough on it and bake them separately for approximately 20 minutes. Once done, allow them to cool slightly, just enough to cut through and enjoy while still warm with your favourite toppings!           FRENCH BAGUETTE This French classic is well-known for its length, crispy crust and chewy interior. Baguette is yet another bread recipe that sounds complicated, but is actually possible to master with practice. The distinguishing factor in all bread recipes is the process and this fool-proof recipe works every time without failure. Baguette is widely popular all over the world and every household has their own way of consuming it. It is a great one to make garlic bread or cheesy toasts, among several other ways in which it can be enjoyed. Baguettes also complement a hearty soup or stew really well. The tall and slender shape of a baguette makes it perfect to make stuffed bread boats as well.            Ingredients 3½ cups flour 1½ cup warm water 1½ tsp yeast 1 tsp sugar 2 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil Method Stir in sugar and yeast into warm water and leave it for five minutes or until the top is frothy. Sprinkle salt onto the flour and mix; pour in the yeast and water mixture into this and stir with a spatula until it comes together. Then, knead the dough with your hands for 6 – 8 minutes. It should be very sticky; you may add flour, not too much, as you go. After the end of the kneading process, the dough should be stretchy and elastic. Scrape the dough with the help of a spatula and drop it in an oiled bowl. Brush the ball of dough with more oil and cover it before allowing it to rest for two hours. After that duration, the dough should puff up and double in size. Generously flour your work surface and drop the dough on it. Knead for a couple more minutes incorporating more flour as you knead. In the end, you should have a light and supple dough. Divide the dough into three equal portions and work with one at a time. Roll and twist the dough, stretching it as well to make a long cylindrical shape. Flour your baking tray and place the loaves on them individually. Flour the top as well and make slits at the top; cover and let it rest for another hour. Meanwhile, take an ovenproof pan and place it at the bottom of your oven while it preheats at 180°C. Once the dough has risen, place it in the middle rack of your oven and pour in cold water in the empty baking dish that has been preheating at the bottom. This will generate steam that helps create that classic crispy exterior and chewy interior. Bake this for 30 minutes and allow it to cool for 10 minutes before slicing in.           KOREAN SAUSAGE BREAD This delicious and cheesy bread recipe is a snack on its own, which is stuffed with sausages, bell pepper, mushroom and corn, all resting on a soft bread made from scratch. To top it off, there is mozzarella cheese atop that creates the most gorgeous cheese-pull when torn apart.    Munching on this delicious snack will make you think of Korean street food. This one is delicious as it is but you may drizzle some barbeque sauce, or a combination of mustard and ketchup for that final touch.  Ingredients For the bread — 2 tsp yeast 1 tbsp sugar ½ cup warm milk 1 egg 2 tbsp oil 2 cups flour 1 tsp salt For the topping — 6 sticks sausages ½ cup boiled corn kernels ¼ cup chopped mushrooms ¼ cup chopped bell peppers 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper 1 tsp paprika ½ tsp chilli flakes ½ tsp dried oregano ½ cup mayonnaise ¼ cup grated cheddar cheese ¼ cup grated mozzarella 1 egg Method To prepare the bread, mix milk, sugar, and yeast and leave it for 10 minutes. Mix this concoction with flour, salt, oil and one beaten egg; combine everything until it forms a dough. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a clean bowl drizzled with oil. Massage the top and sides of the dough with oil and allow it to rest for an hour while covered. Meanwhile, make the stuffing. Mix corn, mushroom and bell pepper along with the condiments, mayonnaise, and grated cheddar cheese. Once the dough has rested sufficiently and risen, knead it with more flour to make it smooth. Shape it into a long cylinder and divide into six equal pieces. Roll out each piece into an oval and place one sausage on it. Encase the sausage entirely with the dough and make 5-6 slits by cutting in through up until the length of the sausage, leaving dough at the base. Pull and twist each disc of sausage covered with bread outwardly so that you have a wide base. Allow this to rest again covered for 15 minutes. After that, brush the tops and sides with a beaten egg and spoon over the prepared mixture on top. Sprinkle over grated mozzarella cheese and bake them in a preheated oven at 170°C for 20-25 minutes before biting in. VENEZUELAN BREAD This fancy Venezuelan bread is nothing short of eye candy. Rolled with layers of soft bread and bacon with a sprinkling of raisins and olives, baking this will make you want to do it repeatedly. It is usually prepared in Venezuela during the holidays and typically contains ham, which has been replaced with smoked bacon in this recipe. This unique bread is delicious as it is but can be the perfect accompaniment in any meal, whether breakfast or dinner. You may also spread a thin layer of mustard over it and munch on it as a snack, or serve this as a side dish to supplement a full meal. Ingredients 1 cup warm milk 2 tsp dry yeast ¼ cup sugar 2 eggs ¼ cup melted butter 4 cups flour 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil 10 slices smoked bacon ½ cup sliced olives ¼ cup raisins Method Mix milk, yeast, and a teaspoon of sugar and leave it to rest for 10 minutes. Once the surface is foamy, add in one egg and melted butter to it and combine. In a large bowl, add flour, salt, and sugar and pour in the mixture. Mix it until a dough is formed and knead it for 8-10 minutes. Roll the dough smoothly into a ball and let it prove in a greased bowl covered for an hour. After an hour, it should double in size. Deflate it and roll the dough into a large rectangle. Cover the surface heavily with slices of bacon leaving some empty space on the sides. Generously sprinkle over chopped olives and raisins. Roll the dough tightly and pinch the seams; let it rest again for 45 minutes while covered. After that, transfer the loaf of bread onto a greased baking tray and brush all the exposed sides with a beaten egg. Pierce the top and sides with a fork to allow steam to escape. Bake this in a preheated oven at 160°C and let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting in.

Add in the yeast and water mixture into the bowl and start stirring everything with a wooden spoon.As the dough comes together, start mixing with your hands. This tends to be very sticky so you may oil your palms. Add the remaining water in little amounts as you go. Stretch the dough, drop it back and then push it against you with the help of your palm. Be careful about not tearing the dough and continue kneading for 8–10 minutes. Once done, the dough should be incredibly light and soft. Slip in the prepared dough into a greased bowl. Cover this and leave it to proof for two hours in a warm place. After two hours, the dough should triple in size. Place the dough on a floured surface and lightly stretch it to a slender rectangle. Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise and cover it again for 15 minutes.At this point, preheat your oven at 170°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Gently place the slices of dough on it and bake them separately for approximately 20 minutes. Once done, allow them to cool slightly, just enough to cut through and enjoy while still warm with your favourite toppings!FRENCH BAGUETTE This French classic is well-known for its length, crispy crust and chewy interior. Baguette is yet another bread recipe that sounds complicated, but is actually possible to master with practice. The distinguishing factor in all bread recipes is the process and this fool-proof recipe works every time without failure. Baguette is widely popular all over the world and every household has their own way of consuming it. It is a great one to make garlic bread or cheesy toasts, among several other ways in which it can be enjoyed. Baguettes also complement a hearty soup or stew really well. The tall and slender shape of a baguette makes it perfect to make stuffed bread boats as well.            Ingredients 3½ cups flour 1½ cup warm water 1½ tsp yeast 1 tsp sugar 2 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil Method Stir in sugar and yeast into warm water and leave it for five minutes or until the top is frothy. Sprinkle salt onto the flour and mix; pour in the yeast and water mixture into this and stir with a spatula until it comes together. Then, knead the dough with your hands for 6 – 8 minutes. It should be very sticky; you may add flour, not too much, as you go. After the end of the kneading process, the dough should be stretchy and elastic. Scrape the dough with the help of a spatula and drop it in an oiled bowl. Brush the ball of dough with more oil and cover it before allowing it to rest for two hours. After that duration, the dough should puff up and double in size. Generously flour your work surface and drop the dough on it. Knead for a couple more minutes incorporating more flour as you knead. In the end, you should have a light and supple dough. Divide the dough into three equal portions and work with one at a time. Roll and twist the dough, stretching it as well to make a long cylindrical shape. Flour your baking tray and place the loaves on them individually. Flour the top as well and make slits at the top; cover and let it rest for another hour. Meanwhile, take an ovenproof pan and place it at the bottom of your oven while it preheats at 180°C. Once the dough has risen, place it in the middle rack of your oven and pour in cold water in the empty baking dish that has been preheating at the bottom. This will generate steam that helps create that classic crispy exterior and chewy interior. Bake this for 30 minutes and allow it to cool for 10 minutes before slicing in.           KOREAN SAUSAGE BREAD This delicious and cheesy bread recipe is a snack on its own, which is stuffed with sausages, bell pepper, mushroom and corn, all resting on a soft bread made from scratch. To top it off, there is mozzarella cheese atop that creates the most gorgeous cheese-pull when torn apart.    Munching on this delicious snack will make you think of Korean street food. This one is delicious as it is but you may drizzle some barbeque sauce, or a combination of mustard and ketchup for that final touch.  Ingredients For the bread — 2 tsp yeast 1 tbsp sugar ½ cup warm milk 1 egg 2 tbsp oil 2 cups flour 1 tsp salt For the topping — 6 sticks sausages ½ cup boiled corn kernels ¼ cup chopped mushrooms ¼ cup chopped bell peppers 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper 1 tsp paprika ½ tsp chilli flakes ½ tsp dried oregano ½ cup mayonnaise ¼ cup grated cheddar cheese ¼ cup grated mozzarella 1 egg Method To prepare the bread, mix milk, sugar, and yeast and leave it for 10 minutes. Mix this concoction with flour, salt, oil and one beaten egg; combine everything until it forms a dough. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a clean bowl drizzled with oil. Massage the top and sides of the dough with oil and allow it to rest for an hour while covered. Meanwhile, make the stuffing. Mix corn, mushroom and bell pepper along with the condiments, mayonnaise, and grated cheddar cheese. Once the dough has rested sufficiently and risen, knead it with more flour to make it smooth. Shape it into a long cylinder and divide into six equal pieces. Roll out each piece into an oval and place one sausage on it. Encase the sausage entirely with the dough and make 5-6 slits by cutting in through up until the length of the sausage, leaving dough at the base. Pull and twist each disc of sausage covered with bread outwardly so that you have a wide base. Allow this to rest again covered for 15 minutes. After that, brush the tops and sides with a beaten egg and spoon over the prepared mixture on top. Sprinkle over grated mozzarella cheese and bake them in a preheated oven at 170°C for 20-25 minutes before biting in. VENEZUELAN BREAD This fancy Venezuelan bread is nothing short of eye candy. Rolled with layers of soft bread and bacon with a sprinkling of raisins and olives, baking this will make you want to do it repeatedly. It is usually prepared in Venezuela during the holidays and typically contains ham, which has been replaced with smoked bacon in this recipe. This unique bread is delicious as it is but can be the perfect accompaniment in any meal, whether breakfast or dinner. You may also spread a thin layer of mustard over it and munch on it as a snack, or serve this as a side dish to supplement a full meal. Ingredients 1 cup warm milk 2 tsp dry yeast ¼ cup sugar 2 eggs ¼ cup melted butter 4 cups flour 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp oil 10 slices smoked bacon ½ cup sliced olives ¼ cup raisins Method Mix milk, yeast, and a teaspoon of sugar and leave it to rest for 10 minutes. Once the surface is foamy, add in one egg and melted butter to it and combine. In a large bowl, add flour, salt, and sugar and pour in the mixture. Mix it until a dough is formed and knead it for 8-10 minutes. Roll the dough smoothly into a ball and let it prove in a greased bowl covered for an hour. After an hour, it should double in size. Deflate it and roll the dough into a large rectangle. Cover the surface heavily with slices of bacon leaving some empty space on the sides. Generously sprinkle over chopped olives and raisins. Roll the dough tightly and pinch the seams; let it rest again for 45 minutes while covered. After that, transfer the loaf of bread onto a greased baking tray and brush all the exposed sides with a beaten egg. Pierce the top and sides with a fork to allow steam to escape. Bake this in a preheated oven at 160°C and let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting in.

114,"Mental health condition is an important aspect of our existence. It incorporates everything from our emotional state of being to our psychological and social well-being. Our mental health, positive or negative, affects how we think, make life changing decisions or even who we choose to be friends with. It is extremely important at every stage of our lives, from early childhood through adolescence to even adulthood.  There is no way, that we can skip maintenance of our psychiatric needs at any given point and still expect to live healthy and functioning lives. ""And this message needs to get through,"" says Rehnuma- E-Jannat, Psychological Counsellor, PHWC (Psychological Health and Wellness Clinic).  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.  Shabab Sabbir, a 28-year-old from Wari, Old Dhaka, is a graphics designer by day and student by night. His full-time schedule impedes him from spending quality time with friends or even family. Additionally, with the pandemic hovering over, his schedule somehow became shoddier than ever, and Sabbir was no longer living a normal life – a common complaint by loved ones. He was not sleeping properly or feeling any attraction towards his favourite meals. Most of the time he was found lying on the couch, fatigued, tensed and irritable. His parents became concerned, not knowing what to do, they consulted with neighbours first, who referred a specialist to the family. Today, Sabbir is back on his feet, thanks to the well-wishers, directing his family to the right course of action. Having completed his MBA successfully, he is pursuing better work opportunities elsewhere, one that matches his depth and competence. Sabbir has finally learned ways to spend quality time with loved ones, even amidst a hectic schedule, and has also taken up new hobbies, ones which he had been keen on adopting for long. Was there any fairy-tale like enchantment involved…? ""Not at all,"" Jannat reminds us, ""Sabbir had been suffering from 'untreated borderline depression' for years, which got worse during the frenzied pandemic, but with consistent therapy he was thankfully able to get back on his feet, leading a healthy lifestyle once again."" Jannat added on to say, ""Most of the time the answer is very easy. All a person has to do is meet with a psychologist or a psychiatrist and talk their way through mental health obstructions.""            Shamima Akter, Psychological Counsellor, PHWC, further breaks down the process for us. ""Mental health has been a long unaddressed issue in this part of the continent, 'a topic', which we do not feel free to discuss at all because of the associated stigma. ""People consulting mental health practitioners are termed derogatively as 'pagol' and their medics as 'pagol er daktar.' It's so demeaning! We do not realise that physical and mental health actually go hand in hand, if one is not satisfactory, then the other is equally affected."" According to both the psychologists, many patients who suffer from borderline mental dysfunctions could be easily treated with light therapies such as consultation, and one-to- one sessions with the practitioners. Instead, the patients 'prefer/choose' to hide their conditions in fear of the associated stigma, making the condition worse.           ""Mental health is as important as physical health, if we go to the doctor for fever or a cough, then we should also go to a therapist when we feel anxious or agitated. A consultant can deduce the real reasons behind our problems and help in overcoming the unwanted condition,"" revealed Akter. Finally, all being said, we assume that in the 21st century, people should be more empathetic towards people suffering from psychological distress, as they are to any other medical disorder, and should be 'informed and educated' enough to be able to direct the longsuffering, to a registered mental health clinic, if and when required.

115,"While we are all familiar with the common methods to nurture hair that include oiling, shampooing, conditioning, applying packs, and various hair treatments, what is scalp detox? Does one really need it?Scalp detox is essentially the method of deep cleansing the scalp to get rid of built-up debris and rebalance the pH of the skin. Over time, despite our regular cleansing routine, product, dirt, sweat, and oil can clog our hair follicles creating an unfavourable environment for the hair. Thus, a scalp detox is needed occasionally.""The skin of our head is simply an extension of the skin on our face. And just like we would exfoliate or scrub our face from time to time, our scalp requires the same care,"" explained Farzana Shakil, Beauty Expert and Image Consultant.Scalp detox is not very popular in our region but with time as advances are made and research unravels new techniques of personal care, detoxing the scalp seems to make its way to the list of necessities. Furthermore, the hot and humid climate of our country prompts problems such as itchiness, stickiness, and dandruff that calls for a refresh.""Detoxing the scalp promotes blood stimulation, which in turn improves the scalp health. Just like plants require fertile soil to grow, our hair also needs a healthy scalp for its nourishment. To attain this, just shampooing is often not enough,"" Farzana further explained.Our body has an amazing mechanism that signals us when something is off. Likewise, when you can feel noticeable build-up and debris along with itching and flaking on the scalp, it may be time for a detox. Hair feeling waxy or oily is another telling sign that a detox is needed.Hair detox can be done once a month or more or less often as required. This will depend on a variety of other lifestyle factors such as how often you wash your hair, how oily your scalp is, your exercise routine, and whether or not you cover your hair. Environmental factors should also be taken into consideration such as the level of pollution in your area and its climate.  However, be careful about overdoing it especially for those who have dry or damaged hair strands or if you have sensitive or broken skin on the scalp. The method used for detoxing the scalp is another aspect that will dictate its frequency.  There are several products and home remedies that can be applied for a proper and effective scalp detox. Apple cider vinegar, scrubbing products, aloe vera, and sugar are all viable options. However, one must be wary about using such products because everyone's skin is different. Thus, it is advisable to do a skin patch test first.""Some other options for detoxing the scalp include clarifying shampoo, friction massage, and soft scrub. Detoxification will keep the hair clean and healthy while eliminating dead skin cells and unclogging hair follicles,"" added Farzana Shakil.   Detoxing the scalp forms a favourable environment for hair to receive all the nourishment it requires, creating optimal conditions to thrive. If done correctly, adding this to your beauty regimen will let you dazzle all with those luscious locks.

116,"The key lies in your muscles. At rest, 1 pound of muscle burns three times as many calories every day just to sustain itself—and a lot of those calories that muscle burns off come from fat storage units. Muscle is constantly burning fat off!Now before I go any further, I know most women are afraid to hear the word muscle, because that means getting bulky like men. One must realise, muscles can get stronger without getting bigger. Women have very low testosterone (the hormone responsible for making men bulk up). This is why when women weight train, their result is a natural lean and tone shape.  For men who crave to get big: increasing the size of the muscle almost inevitably increases strength. So it all comes down to the specific training technique as per your body's need.Why be obsessed with muscle?Muscles are essential for maintaining how we breathe, how we move, metabolism, and posture. It's simple, the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism.Decrease depression —Resistance exercise training was associated with a 45 percent reduction in multiple depressive symptoms (according to a meta-analysis of 33 randomized controlled trials).Boost brain performanceTraining for muscle increases neurotrophic factors in the brain. Just 30 minutes of exercise increases this 2-3 fold. These cause your brain to make new neurons in areas involved in learning/memory. They also repair damaged neurons.Fight fat storageMuscles are more metabolically efficient than fat mass, allowing you to burn more calories at rest. Clinical data shows that your metabolic rate is increased up to 72 hours after strength-training exercise. This means that you are still burning additional calories hours and even days after your workout.Insulin ResistanceBy partnering the powerful combination of whole food nutrition with strength training, insulin resistance can be reversed.  Strength training stimulates greater glucose metabolism during and right after a workout.Weight training triggers an adaptive response for more muscle and thus greater metabolic potential for the next workout. This compounding effect leads to improved insulin sensitivity due to the improvements in muscle strength.Three must-do muscle building exercises I am obsessed with three specific moves. And I know that once you learn it and see just how strong you actually are…you will fall in love with weight training too. Squat Nothing challenges your central nervous system more than a squat. It pushes you to the edge and helps engage your entire system. This full body compound exercise is a tool for gaining strength, and mobility. Learn the correct form and practice daily. Deadlift Sounds scary but this compound exercise is crucial for lower back strength. Weak back muscle is a dangerous condition we must prevent. Beginners should start with low weight and work with higher reps to build balance in lower back, hips, and leg muscles. Bench-press This is a functional upper body exercise for women and men. Bench-press exercises comes in several variations used to target all large muscle groups.           Final thoughts Strength training means slowing and reversing the aging process at the cellular and genetic level, increase your energy, protect against the effects of aging, improve insulin resistance (the kindling for all sorts of diseases), and improve brain function. Exercise can reverse your biological age by nearly a decade, give you more energy, maintain a healthy lifestyle, help you avoid aches and pains, and protect your brain and cognitive ability. A busy lifestyle has become the new definition for success. Sleep deprived, back pain, and fatigue are the new normal. And off course, everyone hates their tummy fat, right? This harmful thought pattern has become the unseen poison of our society. But you can start the change from today. Strength changes everything. Be a muscle maniac!

117,"Acne is dreaded by most teens, but by the time you are an adult, its simply an unwelcome guest that's far outstayed its welcome. Acne happens for a lot of different reasons and so, many of those reasons overlap one another that you cannot always find the exact culprit. Our mothers and our grandmothers before them have gone through similar issues and they had no LED face therapies and anti-acne facials to turn to. Their kitchens were their havens and that's where they mastered the cure to this age-old pesky problem. And that's exactly where we are heading right now, to give you some tried and tested home remedies to kiss, or rather, kick, acne goodbye!Apple Cider Vinegar A mild acidic vinegar, made from the unfiltered juices of pressed apples, is said to have bacteria killing properties that might also reduce inflammation and improve the appearance of the scars caused by acne. While there is no evidence to support the claim that apple cider vinegar directly cures acne, vinegar does fight bacteria and fungi, thereby proving its effectiveness.Honey and Cinnamon Acne is nothing but bacteria and what can be more potent than honey and cinnamon for that problem? Honey and cinnamon bark have been known to have antibacterial properties and there's research to prove it.Green tea Anyone who knows anything about good health and modern day health elixirs swear by green tea as an antioxidant-packed drink that makes one look younger, lose weight and live a long and healthy life in various other ways. However, plant-based compounds and antioxidants can also do amazingly when applied directly on acne as they can reduce sebum production and fight inflammation to reduce production of acne on skin. While over-the-counter lotions and creams with green tea extract are widely available, its much simpler to make your own solution at home.Tea Tree oil You may have to venture a little further out of your kitchen for this one but we swear it is worth it. Tea tree oil is an over-the-counter essential oil that can be found at any local pharmacy. With anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties, this oil works like magic on fungal and bacterial infections as well as inflammations of all sorts. Extracted from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a tree endemic to Australia, Tea Tree Oil is less dry on the skin and less irritating than other remedies.When acne is there, fighting and getting rid of it can be as easy as stepping into your kitchen or the nearest pharmacy. But in order to really prevent these unsightly zits from even making an appearance, a healthy lifestyle is a must. We can also follow basic skincare rules such as not going to sleep with make up on and exfoliating and moisturising routinely.Make your own solution at homeAs adults and high functioning members of society, we may not realistically live entirely stress-free lives which is optimum for good, acne free, healthy skin, we can still try and help our skin by incorporating zinc and omega 3 fats into our diets and eating foods that have a low glycaemic load and less dairy content.A simple solution with one-part tea tree oil and 9 parts water, applied on the affected area will dry out the acne. For a clingier zit, apply twice a day.Boil green tea for a good 3 to 4 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool. Then pour it into a spray bottle and spritz it on your face as many times as required. Wash once your face has completely dried. The residue of the leaves need not go to waste either. Simply add it to a base of honey and use it as a face mask.Simply mix one-part vinegar to three (or more for sensitive skin) parts water and apply using a clean cotton ball. Let it dry for 20 seconds before washing off with cool water. Repeat this process up to two times in the day. It is important to note that because apple cider vinegar may cause some irritation, it is important to use it in small quantities and dilute it with adequate amounts of water.To make this rich paste, mix two tablespoons of honey to one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. Wash your face and apply the mask. Leave the mask on for 10 to 15 minutes before washing it off. Be sure to pat the face dry as rubbing may irritate the acne.Photo: LS Archive/ Sazzad Ibne Sayed",life_living
118,"To put it simply, arthritis is a kind of inflammation and can happen at one or more joints of the body at the same time. The two main types of arthritis are osteoarthritis — that involves wear-and-tear damage to a joint's cartilage and rheumatoid arthritis — when the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough covering that encloses all the joint parts. Usually, any joint in the body can be affected by arthritis but it is most common in the knees, hips, and elbows.According to Dr Nazmee Kabir, Evercare Hospital Dhaka, bone loss usually starts at the age of 30 (especially in women) and the onset of arthritis is more likely to begin in the early 50s. She adds that women are more prone to getting arthritis, especially during or after menopause. This specifically happens since there is a myriad of complex hormonal changes ongoing in the body during that time.Are osteoporosis and arthritis the same? Dr Kabir aptly highlights the key difference between these familiar medical conditions. ""Osteoporosis and arthritis are actually two very different conditions,"" she began. A joint has cartilage that causes the smoothness, and acts as the shock absorber during any movement. When there is damage, especially continual, to this cartilage, arthritis starts to set in."" She added, ""However, osteoporosis occurs when the density of the bone decreases."" For women, there is a sharp decline in bone density, especially after menopause and this is what leads them to have osteoporosis. Interestingly, in severe cases, osteoporosis and arthritis can even take place simultaneously in a person's body but in different joints.                        Myriad causes of arthritis Obesity Arthritis most commonly affects the lower joints and the key reason it occurs is due to being overweight or obese. ""When we walk or stand, we put most of our weight on our spine, hips, legs, and knees, and as we gain weight, our limbs are not able to support our body as much,"" Dr Kabir explained. This causes cartilage damage, eventually leading to stiffness or swelling of the joints. Age and sex The risk of having arthritis naturally increases with age and it is more common in females (mostly due to menopause, pregnancy and general deficiency in calcium intake in this part of the subcontinent). During menopause, the muscles become more relaxed and weaker, and women tend to gain more weight at that time due to the various hormonal changes going on inside their body. Pregnancy and childbirth Even childbirth and pregnancy can lead to arthritis. During this time, a woman is bearing more than her usual body weight and it enhances the wear and tear of joint tissues.           Family history In some cases, arthritis may emerge from a genetic disposition as well, in case the patient's immediate family (parents/siblings) had suffered.   Previous trauma Having a history of trauma where the bone joint was hurt and did not heal in the right way (for example, a fracture that did not heal properly), can also lead to arthritis in the adjacent joints. Additionally, there are some auto-immune diseases, which may also lead to getting secondary arthritis. Symptoms — Pain Ranging between mild, moderate and severe, pain is the most common symptom that any arthritis patient is bound to experience. Stiffness Stiffness or locking of the joints is another general indication of arthritis. One may be unable to feel or move their joints, especially after a long period of inactivity. Sometimes, one may even wake up in the morning and find their fingers or toes feeling stiff. In severe cases, there may even be deformities of the joints.           Swelling and redness Often, the damage in the cartilage that causes friction in the joints lead to some swelling and redness that is externally visible to the arthritis patient. Difficulty in walking When you are already weak in the knees, walking is not an easy task. Limping is quite normal for people suffering from arthritis in their hips or knees. Crepitus Dr Kabir defines crepitus as ""the cracking sound or feeling in the joints"" and it is very common to feel this during arthritis. Seeking specialist help — Dr Kabir advises to seek specialist guidance right from the first phase of pain. ""Once you consult a specialist in the initial stage, it becomes easier for the specialist to identify why the pain is happening, the type of arthritis and which stage you are in so that they can guide you properly,"" she elaborated. The treatment for each stage is different, so an early diagnosis is always helpful to find the right way to begin the treatment process. A multidisciplinary approach is the best kind of method to start off arthritis treatment and highly recommended by Dr Kabir. In a multidisciplinary approach, while a specialist will diagnose the cause and stage of the arthritis, a physiotherapist will show the exercise routine required and simultaneously, a dietician will guide the patient regarding nutrition and diet.           Medication or physiotherapy Medications, according to Dr Kabir, are only for symptom relief in case of arthritis. It is deemed a temporary relief for the pain, while in some cases, they work somewhat to improve the joint tissue but there is not enough evidence on this yet. For severe cases, injections, steroids, and anesthesia are also applied. ""Physiotherapy, on the other hand, can give you realistic and longer term relief from the pain and helps to make the muscle around your joints stronger,"" Dr Kabir revealed. The joint space is reduced in arthritis and physio helps to give traction to the feet and increase that crammed up space so it is much more relieving than medication. In fact, as per Dr Kabir, physio has evidently helped to significantly improve the condition of patients suffering from knee arthritis. In very severe cases, a total knee/joint/hip replacement surgery may be required by the patient. ""This kind of surgery has become more prevalent within the country in the last decade,"" Dr Kabir assured. These severe case patients usually face serious difficulty in walking or even just standing up as they have hardly any joint space left, the bones are locked in together and their only ray of hope at that point is a prosthesis placement through surgery. While this surgery is usually undertaken by elderly patients and it may involve few age-related risks and complications, it is a surgery lasting 2-3 hours and post-surgery care includes regular physiotherapy and rehabilitation for a month or two. The lifetime of the prosthesis is about 15 to 20 years and these patients usually do not face any problems in the long run and in rare cases, they might need a revision surgery. Healing and caring — Analgesics Dr Kabir elucidated that the general advice to fight pain is to take analgesics like paracetamol at home. ""Anything more powerful than that would surely require specialist advice,"" she mentioned. Warm compressions That hot water bag you stowed away in a drawer somewhere might just be your best friend when experiencing joint pains. Warm compressions really help to relieve the pain, swelling and redness. Joint-specific exercise Exercising on your specific joints, can help to make the muscles around your bones stronger and prevent from arthritis condition getting more aggravated. Weight reduction Maintaining a normal body weight (as per your own BMI) can help to keep arthritis at bay. Active lifestyle and healthy food According to Dr Kabir, just regularly staying active overall and having a healthy diet that is especially rich in calcium, vitamins and minerals can definitely help fight arthritis and keep it in check even if you start experiencing it. Although the process of arthritis causes cartilage damage that is almost irreparable, the pain might tend to peak like a sinus curve, decrease gradually and become episodic, and in some cases, it might even go away completely. The most crucial part of healing from arthritis is acceptance. Arthritis is one of the most common age-related ailments that in all honesty, it is irreversible and has no exact preventions. But what we do know is how to heal and care for ourselves when we experience it. That is why, the first step is to be alert when the first pain hits, and start with a multidisciplinary approach with regular checkups, to step into a life where we can learn to live with arthritis while having it under full control.

These severe case patients usually face serious difficulty in walking or even just standing up as they have hardly any joint space left, the bones are locked in together and their only ray of hope at that point is a prosthesis placement through surgery. While this surgery is usually undertaken by elderly patients and it may involve few age-related risks and complications, it is a surgery lasting 2-3 hours and post-surgery care includes regular physiotherapy and rehabilitation for a month or two. The lifetime of the prosthesis is about 15 to 20 years and these patients usually do not face any problems in the long run and in rare cases, they might need a revision surgery.Healing and caring —Analgesics Dr Kabir elucidated that the general advice to fight pain is to take analgesics like paracetamol at home. ""Anything more powerful than that would surely require specialist advice,"" she mentioned.Warm compressions That hot water bag you stowed away in a drawer somewhere might just be your best friend when experiencing joint pains. Warm compressions really help to relieve the pain, swelling and redness.Joint-specific exercise Exercising on your specific joints, can help to make the muscles around your bones stronger and prevent from arthritis condition getting more aggravated.Weight reduction Maintaining a normal body weight (as per your own BMI) can help to keep arthritis at bay.Active lifestyle and healthy food According to Dr Kabir, just regularly staying active overall and having a healthy diet that is especially rich in calcium, vitamins and minerals can definitely help fight arthritis and keep it in check even if you start experiencing it.Although the process of arthritis causes cartilage damage that is almost irreparable, the pain might tend to peak like a sinus curve, decrease gradually and become episodic, and in some cases, it might even go away completely. The most crucial part of healing from arthritis is acceptance. Arthritis is one of the most common age-related ailments that in all honesty, it is irreversible and has no exact preventions. But what we do know is how to heal and care for ourselves when we experience it. That is why, the first step is to be alert when the first pain hits, and start with a multidisciplinary approach with regular checkups, to step into a life where we can learn to live with arthritis while having it under full control.

119,"In contrast to the myths that foster the misconception that menopause is a tumultuous time, if embraced and dealt with in the right manner, it can certainly be a positive time of life too. Although menopause can cause some noticeable and uncomfortable changes, these can be effectively managed too. After all, this is nothing but a normal process of aging and no woman is the first one going through it all alone.Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ""A woman is like a teabag; you can't tell how strong she is unless you put her into hot water."" Just like this quote goes, from bleeding every month to giving birth to new life — a woman goes through it all in her lifetime. And in all these phases of her life as she grows and ages, her body evolves dramatically too.The menarche, or the very first period cycle of an average woman's life tends to take place between the age of 10 and 16. Henceforth as she grows older, she continues to have her regular periods on a monthly basis. However, between her early 40s and 50, she usually goes through three critical stages of biological changes in her life, each of which affects her physical and mental health significantly. This cluster of changes is known as climacteric, (commonly known as menopause) which occurs over a period of time in three phases and it is the period when a woman experiences decline in her fertility and sexual activity.Dr Syeda Husna Akhter, Senior Consultant, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Bangladesh Medical College and Hospital, highlighted each phase in detail.""A woman goes through a plethora of hormonal and metabolic changes in her lifetime; in fact, the last one-third of a woman's life is spent almost completely without any ovarian functions,"" she explained.Dr Akhter added that this timeline specifically, is a very critical one in every woman's life as this is when she tends to become the most self-conscious and needs the most amount of physical and mental care from the people around her.Menopause in Stages and Symptoms PerimenopauseThe first phase, known as perimenopause or menopausal transition, begins as early as few years (late 30s or 40s) before the actual menopausal period. This is the stage when a woman's ovaries start to gradually produce lesser and lesser estrogen — the key hormone that aids a woman's reproductive and sexual developments. Usually, this phase may last 3-4 years and ends when a woman has gone about a year without having regular periods.One of the most common symptoms of perimenopause is hot flashes; this gives the incumbent a sudden feeling of heat, causing sweating and redness of the skin and face. Sometimes, it happens at night and are known as ""night sweats"" and may even leave you with rapid heart rate and chills as well.Dr Akhter further added that while hot flashes are a key symptom, other symptoms include scanty or delayed periods, fatigue, vaginal dryness, irritability and mood swings.MenopauseIn this stage, a woman proceeds from a reproductive to a non-reproductive stage in her life where she can no longer get pregnant naturally.""At this point, she has been through months (almost a year) without having periods and she is going through a serious physical and emotional change simultaneously,"" Dr Akhter pointed out.Similar to perimenopause, hot flashes continue to occur during menopause as well. Indigestion, following by bloating and/or constipation are also common symptoms according to Dr Akhter. Adding to that, an average woman may also experience a variety of indications relating to mental health and some common symptoms include depression, lethargy, irritability vertigo, headache, insomnia, anxiety, mood swings and even forgetfulness.Post menopauseThis occurs in the period after a woman has not bled for an entire year or longer, and is basically the rest of her life after going through menopause. Hot flashes are usually quite reduced in this phase.  However, according to Dr Akhter, post-menopausal health is equally important and it is crucial to look out for any peculiar or severe symptoms or after-effects.For certain women, developing osteoporosis — health issues relating to the bones and muscles — is quite common. The symptoms of osteoporosis include backache, fractures on minimal trauma, decreased height, and mobility. Moreover, after menopause, women may also become prone to having cardiovascular diseases as they experience hypertension and generally fat deposition also increases in this stage. In fact, in some cases relating to mental health, depression also heightens in an alarming manner.Dr Akhter further discussed more serious cases when due to the mucus linings thinning out and drying up (dry vagina), atrophic changes occur along the female genitalia when the elastic tissues start to get replaced by fibrous ones. This may lead to painful consequences such as vaginal bleedings, irritation, inflammation, and even urinary tract infections (UTIs) and urinary incontinence. Finding relief in distressEven though so much happens while a woman is going through her menopausal transition, there are of course several ways in which she can make her journey easier.On this note, Dr Akhter strongly recommended that mental support and comfort is the most important remedy and reassurance for every woman going through these phases.""It is the duty of her family, friends and loved ones around her to make her feel safe, loved and protected in this time of turmoil when she might be feeling the most vulnerable,"" she stated.Being a part of support groups/communities where she can speak with others going through similar journeys can also make her feel a like she's in a safe space.Having a balanced diet, filled with fresh fruits, vegetables, vitamin supplements, and the appropriate amount of fluids/water is another core component of coping with menopause. Especially, to prevent the occurrence of osteoporosis, Dr Akhter advises to increase the intake of calcium and Vitamin D-rich food, go for early morning sunbathing, and form an active lifestyle.In fact, regular exercise, yoga, meditation and walking — an overall active lifestyle also helps significantly to reduce the downsides of menopausal stages. In some cases, specialist help may be sought for artificial treatments. Usually the specialist will tend to prescribe few hormone tests, and after successful results they may move on to prescribing estrogen supplements coupled with calcium; this is a kind of a short-term hormone replacement therapy and helps the body to produce estrogen artificially.However, Dr Akhter cautions that in case the patient has any previous history of breast cancer, jaundice, etc. then aggressive estrogen therapy may lead to undesirable and severe health conditions such as cancer.As life goes on  After all that has happened, it is crucial to remember that menopause is a very natural biological process of life and every woman has to go through it when it is time.""Just like menarche happens in its time, so does menopause,"" said Dr Akhter comfortingly. The focus should lie primarily on how to live on normally after menopause has occurred.

120,"The nature trails of Bangladesh have a lot to offer, be it to flora and fauna enthusiasts or those looking for a spiritual experience. The roar of cascading waterfalls after monsoons, and the chirping of rare and exotic birds in unadulterated terrain, have a way of calling back those who have had a taste of trekking.For Saim Bin Mujib, a journalist and seasoned trekker, treks have always been a mode of self-discovery. ""Trekking always reminds me of what I am capable of. It tests my limits and demands my body to pull through, even when I think there is no option but to surrender. Whether it is the white-outs of foreign mountains, or hours of exhaustion and dehydration beyond what my body can bear locally, the hurdles help me get in tune with myself,"" explained Saim.Although testing your limits may be a life-changing experience, in your first few treks, it is best to be cautious and prepared. Here are some things to keep in mind, according to Saim, during the first few times you venture out.Places to pin Hills, slopes, and mountains can be a bit more challenging but the rewarding views near waterfalls and peaks usually make it worth it. If you want to experience the distinct serenity waterfalls induce with their majestic appearance and white noise, you should keep Hum Hum waterfall, Khoiyachora waterfall and Nafa-khum waterfall on your list. Although waterfalls are the liveliest during the peak of monsoon, it may be risky for newbies to trek then, as the soil may be extra slippery. ""September and October may be the best time to visit as the waterfalls still retain their beauty near the end of monsoon, without the trails being too difficult to navigate,"" advised Saim.          Photo: Saim Bin Mujib If you would rather trek through plains and flat lands, Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Lawachara National Park and St Martin's 360° are good options. Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawachara National Park are the perfect fix for those who are curious about the evergreen and deciduous forest biomes of Bangladesh. Both nature reserves house a wealth of plant, bird, primate, and reptile species, many of which are rare and endangered. Dressing the part Although there is usually no worry regarding weather extremities in Bangladesh, it is best to stay prepared. During winter, full length pants and windbreaker jackets are ideal as the weather tends to get pretty cold in the high altitudes during the morning and evening. Windbreakers are light but protective so they are the best for trekking. ""The sunlight can still get scorching by noon, so you may find yourself taking off your windbreaker anyways,"" remarked Saim. For summer, a breathable t-shirt, and some half or three-quarter pants can usually get the job done. Although sneakers are good for winter, they may feel too suffocating during summer months. Sandals with a good grip and a supportive back strap are the better option during warmer months. If there is a chance of rain, carry a raincoat. Your backpack should be one that is specialised for travel. The extra straps help evenly distribute the weight of the bag, while also supporting your balance.          Photo: Saim Bin Mujib Packing the necessities It is often hard to strike a balance between packing everything you need and ensuring your backpack stays light. Regardless, there are some items you must always have within easy reach. Make sure you have an emergency kit with all the medicine and supplies you may need. ""The first aid box for trekking has some of the more regular items, such as pain killers, band aid, and antacid. Then there are the extras, which you need to make sure you are healthy and hydrated throughout your hike. This includes electrolyte solutions and glucose. Dehydration is a common ailment during hikes,'' warned Saim. If you plan to stay the night, make sure to carry a headlamp or torch as you may need to leave your tent or accommodation when it is pitch black outside. For winters, carry a sleeping bag and extra layers of clothing in case it gets too cold. Guides help When visiting Bandarban, make sure you take a guide.

""We've got one of the highest vaccination rates, which means we can fight this thing. We don't have to surrender to it.""Australia has inoculated nearly 90% of its population above 16 with two doses and shortened the wait time for booster shots after the emergence of the Omicron cases.Morrison, who had been deemed a casual contact after attending an event last week along with a Covid-infected person, said he has been cleared to fly interstate to Queensland after negative test results.""That's what living with the virus is,"" he said.Australia closed its borders in March 2020 in a bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus and had limited the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed entry.

151,"When it comes to business ownership, women just need fair and equal access—something easier said than done. Centuries of common practices and processes have created fundamental gender-based access disparities. Financial marginalisation and limited property rights are also significant impediments to women business owners. These limit potential buyers and business partners from ever seeing innovative solutions that women-owned businesses have created in engineering, automobile parts, logistics or AI, for example. Add conscious and unconscious bias to the mix and it is often an uphill battle requiring specific focus to overcome the hurdles.To better understand the obstacles that women business owners face across South Asia, the US Department of State's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs helped fund research on their status in corporate value chains and why so few of them win procurement contracts from corporate buyers. WEConnect International, a global non-profit that helps women-owned businesses compete in the global marketplace through capacity development and connections to large buyers, conducted the research as part of its ""Women's Empowerment through Economic Inclusion"" project, where 399 women-owned businesses and 199 large corporate buyers were surveyed.Some key regional takeaways from the women-owned businesses surfaced. These are: women-owned businesses are unable to effectively articulate their unique selling propositions and differentiate themselves from competitors; the lack of access by women to business networks, due to socio-cultural barriers, continues to keep men's and women's affairs separate; and women are at a disadvantage when accessing the full range of debt and equity alternatives required to set up and grow a business.In Bangladesh, lack of capital remains the most challenging issue with 90 percent of women business owners identifying it as the biggest impediment to running their businesses, while 48 percent indicated that a lack of connections to procurement and corporate buyers is a significant challenge.From the end of the buyers, a few crucial issues came up that need to be dealt with. For starters, the majority of corporate buyers did not have policies or practices in place to source from women-owned businesses. Although many buyers indicated product/service quality to be a key determinant in the selection of suppliers, they could not effectively pinpoint if women-owned businesses were lacking in this area. The disconnect between the business language of the buyers and women-owned businesses is also a concern. On top of that, buyers are tied to corporate credit policies that are often at odds with the needs of women-owned businesses, which are smaller and unable to withstand the pressures of longer-term credit recovery. Finally, there is a poor understanding among buyers on Gender Inclusive Sourcing practices.In Bangladesh, with respect to sourcing from women-owned businesses, 52 percent of buyers said they do not, 29 percent said they do, while 19 percent said they do not know. In addition, the majority of the respondents said they did not know how to find women-owned businesses.This is a problem with a solution: Gender-inclusive sourcing is a proactive supplier diversity strategy that addresses gender gaps in value chains to increase access to markets for women-owned businesses. The research indicates that there is appetite for change.The majority of buyers believe there is high potential to create market linkages, and 86 percent of corporate buyers are willing to buy from women-owned businesses when quality standards are met. Research suggests that there is a demand and supply match across many product and service categories in all countries. On average, 82 percent of corporate buyers are willing to learn about Gender Inclusive Sourcing practices and implement them in their organisations, and there is significant potential for women-owned businesses to become tier two and tier three suppliers to corporations.As beneficial as it is to the business owners themselves, and the communities in which they operate, investing in women-owned businesses also makes dollars and sense for large organisational buyers. Small changes to large organisational buying practices such as inclusive sourcing policies can have a significant impact on the business and its ability to find the best products and services at the best price, especially from women-owned businesses.Now is the time for Bangladesh to focus on empowering women and achieving gender equality. As the world slowly begins to adjust to a pandemic-stricken environment, harnessing the power of the entire business community to accelerate recovery and create opportunities for its citizens becomes the smartest strategy of all.

163,"Chittagong port handled 31.15 lakh twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers so far this year, the highest since it began dealing with containers in 1977, as the economy of Bangladesh is returning to normalcy at a faster clip. The premier seaport of the country handled these import, export and empty containers as of yesterday, according to data from the traffic department of the Chittagong Port Authority (CPA).The CPA prepares the data by calculating the number of containers loaded and unloaded at the main jetties of the port, the Pangaon Inland Container Terminal in Keraniganj, and the Kamalapur Inland Container Depot (ICD) in Dhaka.""This is a very good sign. We hope export and import will continue to grow,"" said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), which represents the readymade garment industry that brings 84 per cent of the country's $38.7 billion export earnings.Annual container handling by the port crossed 30 lakh TEUs for the first time in 2019. The growth in the container handling was in the negative last year because of the drop in foreign trade due to the impact of the pandemic.Due to the decrease in the volume of container handling, the port slipped nine notches to 67th in the latest ranking of Lloyd's List's One Hundred Container Ports.Port officials now say the figure may reach 32 lakh TEUs by the end of 2021.Speaking about the record container handling, Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industries Vice President Syed Md Tanvir said, ""It definitely indicates that the country's economy is moving towards the pre-pandemic period. We have already recovered from the hit of the pandemic and we will go further.""""The growth potential is there. We expect that the port will also be ready to handle the growth,"" said Tanvir, also the managing director of Pacific Jeans, a denim exporter.Business leaders say container movement through the port is experiencing higher growth because of the sharp rise in imports and exports. With the reopening of factories following the second wave of Covid-19 since April this year, industrial production has increased.The import of industrial raw materials, especially for the garment sector, has gone up to meet the increased industrial production. Finished goods exports also rose.Syed Nazrul Islam, first vice-president of the BGMEA, appreciated CPA's efficient management for keeping the port operations uninterrupted during countrywide lockdown, helping accelerate import-export activities and sending container handling to a record high.CPA Chairman Rear Admiral M Shahjahan thanked all stakeholders for their contribution that allowed the port to achieve the record container throughput.He says the port authority has closely monitored the activities of private ICDs and took steps, including giving encouragement to the shipping lines for common carrier agreement, to avoid congestion.He said the port was continuously enhancing yard spaces to increase container storage capacity and started a process to purchase 104 types of equipment.A major portion of imported goods are now directly delivered from the port yards after unstuffing from containers, while only 38 types of inbound goods are sent to the private ICDs for delivery, Shahjahan said.If all types of import-laden containers are sent out of the port for delivery, the port, amid its current capacity, would be able to handle up to 4 million TEUs of containers annually.Once the under construction Patenga Container Terminal starts operation, the port would be capable to handle an additional 0.5 million TEUs containers per year.

164,"Malek Spinning has decided to shut the RMG unit of its subsidiary Salek Textile Mills due to continuous losses and low demand for its products.The board of Malek Spinning approved the closure of the readymade garment unit with effect from December 31, 2021 due to accumulated losses and expiry of the lease agreement of the factory building and premises, said the company in a regulatory filing posted on the website of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) yesterday.Malek Spinning holds 97.925 per cent stake in Salek Textile.The RMG unit has a capacity of producing 66 lakh pieces of garment items per annum, according to the company's annual report.The unit produces some special types of denim garments that have gone out of fashion in the international market, said Syed Saiful Haque, company secretary of Malek Spinning.So, it incurred losses in the last two financial years. The loss stood at Tk 12 crore in 2019-20 and Tk 2 crore in 2020-21.The liabilities of the unit will be settled by selling the assets of the unit such as factory plant and machinery, and borrowing from Salek Textile.Malek Spinning will not have to bear any cost related to the settling of the liabilities, said the disclosure. Malek Spinning shares closed 3.19 per cent lower at Tk 27.30 on the DSE yesterday.The textile sector in general, and the RMG sector in particular, had faced various internal and external difficulties, said AFM Zubair, chairman of Malek Spinning, in the annual report for 2020-21.Enhanced and costly compliance standards from customers, new regulations in regard to building and fire safety, high wage rate as fixed by the government, and the price hike of power and gas had had direct negative impact on the cost of production and the price of products and export revenues, making survival difficult, he said.Despite the adverse effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, Malek Spinning had succeeded in clocking higher net profit thanks to an increase in turnover in 2020-2021.Sales rose 53 per cent year-on-year to Tk 1,503 crore in the last financial year, while profits surged to Tk 65 crore reversing from a Tk 33 crore loss in the previous year, according to the annual report.

170,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday advised the government not to extend general forbearance to banks and corporations.The Washington-based multilateral lender also called for phasing out the interest rate caps on lending and deposits.It sounded the alarm about Bangladesh's ongoing economic recovery given the rapid spread of the latest variant of Covid-19, saying that it may have an adverse impact on the rebound.The IMF also suggested the government widen its tax to GDP ratio, ensure exchange rate flexibility and strengthen the business-friendly environment to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).An IMF team offered these recommendations during a press briefing at the InterContinental Dhaka after completing several meetings with different government entities and representatives of businesses, banks and labour unions.Rahul Anand, division chief of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, led the team, which visited Bangladesh between December 5 and December 19 under the multilateral lender's Article IV consultation.The IMF yesterday raised its projection on the country's economic growth for fiscal 2021-22 from 6.5 per cent to 6.6 per cent. However, the projection is still lower than the government's target of 7.2 per cent.The GDP growth is expected to pick up further to hit 7.1 per cent in FY2022-23, the IMF said.Explaining the slight rise in this year's growth forecast for Bangladesh, Anand said the country's export sector was doing well.""We have seen lots of export orders being diverted from Vietnam, Myanmar, China and India to Bangladesh, and that is helping the country increase its export earnings,"" he said.In addition, business activities, including that of the garments sector, have picked up, prompting the IMF to raise its projection.""But, there are uncertainties around this because we still have half a year till the fiscal year ends.The most important thing now is understanding how Covid-19 impacts the countries that are trading partners of Bangladesh,"" Anand said.""Containment measures taken by those countries may have a big impact on the export earnings of Bangladesh and so, anything can go wrong,"" he added.There will be domestic risks as well if Omicron causes a new round of infections. Besides, the price of oil and commodities has gone up in the global market, which may put pressure on the economy.Reflecting non-food price inflation, which rose a 62-month high in October, and the recent hike in fuel prices, inflation is projected to be slightly higher than the central bank's target.So, the central bank should keep a close watch on the inflationary pressure, said the IMF.The IMF division chief went on to say that providing general forbearing during the peak of the pandemic was appropriate to support businesses as it helped spur economic recovery.""Our advice is an orderly exit from all these relaxations that were given to the banks as well as corporations,"" he said.In addition, proper identification of problem assets in the banking sector, which are mostly concentrated in the state-owned lenders, is highly important.Bangladesh needs lots of investment but the high rate of non-performing loans has increased the cost of lending and hindered the smooth disbursal of funds.In terms of corporate governance and other reforms, the authorities are now giving effort to amend five relevant laws, including the Banking Companies Act.The IMF's advice aims to help align the best international practices while amending the five acts, according to Anand.""This will strengthen the financial sector, which will play a major role in upgrading the country to middle-and-higher income status.""Meanwhile, interest rate caps on lending and deposit limit the policy space so they should be phased out to strengthen market-based pricing and improve credit allocation and monetary transmission.Greater exchange rate flexibility together with safeguarding foreign exchange reserves will help buffer external shocks as well.He also touched upon Bangladesh's tax to GDP ratio, which is one the lowest in the world.""We have been discussing the issue with relevant authorities, who are very keen to fix the problem to raise revenue,"" Anand said.As Bangladesh grows and becomes more integrated with the rest of the world, investors compare the country with other nations before making any investment.So, Bangladesh should give emphasis attracting FDI as it is highly important in the context of gaining technology and integrating with the global value chain, said the IMF.The country is now considered a success story as it made substantial progress in the last 50 years.Bangladesh was once one of the poorest nations in the world but has since graduated from the situation, Anand said.""This is a great achievement for the country, which is now fulfilling a good number of the Sustainable Development Goals.""However, a major portion of Bangladesh's export earnings still comes from garments and so, it is time to diversify the export basket, he added.

On many occasions, buyers cancel orders, go bankrupt.Under such circumstances, raw materials imported to make exportable products become liabilities for exporters and they have to sell the items in the local market after paying duty and taxes to the NBR.There is no benefit if the products are not made and exported, he said.Hassan, also managing director of Giant Textiles Ltd, said the NBR's latest decision will be instrumental to increase exports.In general, the NBR grants a 24-month time to the export-oriented factories to hold raw materials to make products and exports.The permission to retain raw materials for additional six months comes from the Customs Bond Commissionerates (CBCs)—one in Dhaka and another in Chattogram—and from the NBR, said an official of the tax administrator.In its latest order issued last week, the NBR said it will consider granting additional bonding period for raw materials if the exporters apply.Export-oriented firms in the export processing zones, economic zones and hi-tech parks will also get scope to apply for time extension if bonding period expires.The NBR will consider the applications case to case basis, according to the notification.""We have done it to facilitate exports,"" said the NBR official.Md Saiful Islam, president elect of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, termed the NBR decision timely.""The latest decision will not affect revenue. If such flexibility on the basis of reality continues, exports will grow,"" he said.",business

173,"Dhaka stocks took a steep dive yesterday as investors continue to suffer from a confidence crisis amid growing tension between Bangladesh Bank and the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC).The DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), nosedived 84 points, or 1.23 per cent, to 6,873.Turnover, an important indicator of the market, stood at Tk 786 crore, down 2 per cent from Tk 807 crore the day before.""Investors are suffering from a confidence crisis due to the deteriorating situation between two regulators regarding some issues,"" said a top official of a merchant bank preferring anonymity.A few weeks back, the BSEC ordered all listed companies, including banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), to deposit their undistributed dividends to the stock market stabilisation fund.It also allowed banks and NBFIs to declare dividends from the current year's profits despite having cumulative losses. However, the central bank ordered them to disregard BSEC's orders.The dispute arose when, after a meeting with Bangladesh Bank, the BSEC said the central bank would change its bank exposure policy by allowing cost-based exposure instead of market value.However, the central bank refuted this, saying no such decision was not taken at the meeting.In such a situation, the fight took a new turn as the BSEC curtailed banks' power to cancel payments to perpetual bond holders.In protest, Bangladesh Bank a sent letter to lenders in the country, saying the BSEC's condition is at odds with central bank guidelines on risk-based capital adequacy.Such a tussle between the two regulators is badly affecting the market, the merchant banker added.Eastern Insurance topped the gainers list yesterday, rising 10 per cent, followed by Asia Insurance, Bangladesh National Insurance, Khan Brothers PP Woven Bag, and Shurwid Industries.Stocks of Beximco Ltd traded the most, worth Tk 73 crore, followed by One Bank, Sonali Paper, Fortune Shoes, and Active Fine Chemicals.SS Steel shed the most, dropping 8.84 per cent, followed by Aramit Cement, Fortune Shoes, Beach Hatchery, and Aziz Pipes.At the DSE, 87 stocks advanced, 266 fell and 25 remained same.The prime bourse suffered yet another setback as investors' mounted sell-offs in all major sectors, including banks and financial institutions, International Leasing Securities said in its daily market review.The DSEX plummeted 85 points as the current market scenario failed to offer any clear indication of recovery for investors.However, several small-caps from various sectors and the general insurance sector remain in the investors' good grace, it added.Among major sectors, based on market capitalization, financial institutions the dropped most followed by food and allied, and bank.Investor activity was mostly concentrated on the bank, general insurance and miscellaneous sectors.The Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) also fell yesterday as the CASPI, the main index of the port city bourse, dropped 336 points, or 1.67 per cent, to 19,738.Among 285 traded stocks, 63 rose, 204 fell and 18 remained unchanged.",business
174,"Real estate developers are concerned about the increasing cost of building materials as well as the proposed Detailed Area Plan (DAP), which will guide future constructions in Dhaka city, according to the Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB).""I fear the price of flats will go up in the future if the cost of construction materials, especially rod and cement, continues to rise and the proposed DAP is implemented,"" said Alamgir Shamsul Al-Amin, president of REHAB.As such, a basic human need such as housing could go beyond the reach of middle-class people if these issues are not addressed.Al-Amin made these comments while discussing the upcoming REHAB Fair during a press conference at Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka yesterday.""So, this year's fair could be a golden opportunity for buyers as various companies will be offering relatively special prices for flats from previously initiated projects,"" he said.Besides, if the housing sector moves forward, so too will backward linkage industries such as cement, paint, steel and ceramics, Al-Amin added.In light of the new DAP being prepared by Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha for the 2017-35 period, the Dhaka Building Construction Rules 2021 are also being framed.If these rules are finalised, the size of buildings approved for construction will shrink by at least 33 per cent to 53 per cent compared to current standards while the price of flats will increase 50 per cent.Opposing the proposed guidelines, REHAB wrote a letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina detailing these issues in the first week of December.The REHAB Fair 2021, a five-day event where members of the REHAB will showcase their housing solutions, is set to begin on December 23 after a two-year hiatus.The fair, to be held at the Bangabandhu International Conference Center in Agargaon, will feature 220 stalls with building material suppliers and financial institutions also taking part.Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi is scheduled to participate in the inaugural ceremony as chief guest.Like every year, visitors who attend the fair will have the chance to win attractive prizes from a raffle draw with their entry tickets.

175,"Debt problems at a major Chinese property developer have now spilled over into a vital artery of the nation's industrial engine - the steel sector - and started to ripple through to other critical parts of the world's second-largest economy.The spreading balance-sheet crisis at real estate firms is a warning for policymakers as a swing in the fortunes of the steel industry would have significant repercussions for China's economy, with cement, glass, and household appliances all vulnerable to demand drops.Already, steel prices are down from their record highs seen earlier this year due to easing demand from construction activities, which account for over half of the metal's consumption, while steelmakers' share prices have also been hurt.Steel's acute sensitivity to the ebbs and flows in construction and manufacturing makes it a closely-tracked bellwether for China's economy, which has started to slow down from the second quarter. Steel firms are also massive employers that support a vast supply chain.Hitting steel operations, real estate developers have dialled back investment in projects to conserve cash in a sector squeezed by tighter borrowing regulations that have engulfed indebted companies, most notably China Evergrande Group.""We normally stockpile steel products in winter at relatively lower prices and sell them after the new year holidays when consumption resumes. But we are holding off this year,"" said Qi Xiaoliang, a Beijing-based steel trader.""There's still uncertainty in the real estate market for 2022 and the situation is not expected to be fully reversed for another six to 12 months,"" he added.In the final quarter of 2021, the property market took a further hit as the unease in the sector shook already weak buyer sentiment, with unsold housing stock in China's 100 biggest cities reaching a five-year high in November.Demand for homes is expected to ease further in 2022, hitting downstream manufacturers of household products.Cement production, another construction material, was down around 16 per cent for September-November year-on-year, and was lower versus the same period between 2017 and 2019. Demand for earth excavators has also dropped off in recent months.The broadening spillover impact of the property downturn was also seen elsewhere. In the appliances industry, for example, monthly refrigerator output has been falling since May through to November on an annual basis.Steel producers were among the best performers of the entire Chinese economy over the first three quarters of 2021, with China's 28 major listed mills pocketing over 106 billion yuan ($16.61 billion) in net profits, up 174 per cent year-on-year and 129 per cent higher than in pre-pandemic 2019.But the boom times in the steel sector are over. The paralysis that has struck China's mammoth construction industry is triggering a rare contraction in building activity across the country.New construction starts by floor area have contracted from a year earlier since July - their longest stretch of declines since 2015.The slowdown in the real estate sector has dented China's monthly crude steel output by more than 20 per cent since September.The closely-tracked steel equity instruments and commodities futures have captured the reversal of fortunes.After gaining roughly 90 per cent through mid-September, the CSI steel equities index has plunged 27 per cent since, while futures prices for construction materials rebar and wire rod have tumbled 24 per cent and 31 per cent respectively from their historical highs to erase almost all their gains this year.As steel producers hit the brakes, the key inputs used in steelmaking have also taken a shellacking, with Dalian Commodity Exchange iron ore futures down more than 45 per cent from their record in May.Gross profits for steel rebar have started to trend down from the peak seen in late September.Property-related sectors are the single biggest contributor to China's economy, accounting for 28 per cent of GDP in 2021, down from a recent peak of 35 per cent in 2016.The GDP share is broken down into a 7 per cent direct contribution from property and a 21 per cent indirect contribution from construction and through sectors along the supply chain such as machinery and equipment, according to Moody's.A government industry consultancy forecast China's steel demand will slip 0.7 per cent in 2022, following an expected 4.7 per cent decline this year.Looking ahead, any extended credit constraints ""could reduce demand for metals used in construction as developers lose the ability to pay for raw materials at high prices,"" analysts with Fitch Solutions wrote in a recent note to clients.If the contraction in construction spending endures, it will then affect the producers of appliances and white goods that constitute a key part of China's critical manufacturing base.""Property construction has been the engine of China's economy for over two decades now,"" said Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC.""With building activity likely to remain depressed for quite some time, growth will inevitably shift down a year or two.""",business
176,"US retailers opened their doors on Saturday to what they hope will be swarms of shoppers searching for last-minute holiday gifts, despite surging cases of the coronavirus, including the new, highly-contagious Omicron variant.The last Saturday before Christmas dubbed 'Super Saturday' is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year, marked by a rush to buy last-minutes gifts to tuck under the Christmas tree.The risks to shoppers this year, however, are not just that merchandise might be out of stock, but also that in-person shopping could trigger more coronavirus infections - making Super Saturday a super-spreader event.Toy store owner Katherine Nguyen says she anticipates more people to shop in person at her three Chicago-area locations compared to the last Saturday before Christmas 2020, or even the last Saturday before the pre-pandemic Christmas of 2019.""It's like the new variant is the new normal the environment has gotten a little used to that,"" she said. Foot-traffic tracking firm Placer.ai said it expects more people to visit stores this weekend than on the same weekend last year.Sensormatic Solutions, a data firm that measures store visits, cited a nearly 48 per cent increase in foot traffic on the Friday after Thanksgiving compared to a year earlier as a sign that people would want to shop in-person.A supply chain logjam has left many people also feeling nervous about not getting merchandise ordered online in time for the December 25 holiday.""Consumers have been bombarded with messages about the impact of supply shortages on the availability of holiday gifts,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.Nguyen said her three stores never received shipments of merchandise for about 15 per cent of their toy catalog.The toys, she says, are  ""sitting on a container in Long Beach, California, outside of the water waiting to come in."" FedEx and the US Postal Service set December 15 as the deadline for ground deliveries to reach homes in time for Christmas, which means that shoppers still in search of gifts may have little choice but to shop in stores if they want to avoid fees for expedited shipping.FedEx and rival United Parcel Service each say they have hired enough workers to manage the holiday peak, when the number of daily packages they handle easily doubles. Unlike last year, many consumers heeded advice from retailers to shop early - easing pressure on carriers by spreading demand over a longer period of time.But online shoppers may see more delays as Christmas approaches, according to Cathy Morrow Roberson, president of consultancy Logistics Trends & Insights.",business
177,"China's antimonopoly bureau will step up legal enforcement against monopolistic behaviour and push forward the amended antimonopoly law to improve the regulatory framework, said Gan Lin, chief of the national antimonopoly bureau.China last month elevated the seniority of the market regulator's antitrust unit, the National Anti-Monopoly Bureau, and appointed Gan as chief, a move which would help antitrust investigators gain resources when examining mergers and acquisitions.Gan said China still faces ""insufficient punishment"" for some monopolistic activities, while some antitrust regulations remain at the elementary level.""With the rapid development of the digital economy, and new industries and business models emerging one after another, there are great differences in competition modes between the new and the traditional economy,"" Gan said in an interview published on the official website of State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Sunday.""There's an urgent need to further improve the anti-monopoly legislation and industry regulation.""China shed its once relatively laissez-faire approach to market regulation of the internet sector in dramatic fashion this year, blocking mergers and imposing a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding for abusing its market position.Alibaba was found to have engaged in the practise of ""choosing one from two,"" in which an e-commerce platform bars vendors from selling on rival sites.Gan said this practice was not evident during China's annual ""618 shopping festival"" and Singles' Day online shopping festival this year after the bureau kicked off a sector-wide rectification.In October, it levied a $527 million fine on food delivery giant Meituan for abusing its dominance.""The orderliness of market competition has shown great improvement, and the smaller business operators have now gained broader space,"" Gan said.For the next step, the bureau will step up antimonopoly reviews of concentrated businesses, and will continue to prevent mergers from disrupting the market, and curb excessive capital expansion, Gan said.",business

179,"Alban Nikolai Herbst's Berlin apartment is covered in dust, his precious record collection included, thanks to a coal-powered stove he still uses to heat his home like thousands across the city.Germany's new government is set to extinguish the at-home heat source from a bygone era as part of its ambitious climate plans, as it looks to cut harmful emissions linked to climate change.But Herbst says he remains attached to his coal-powered stove, which he clings to for  ""sentimental"" reasons.Arriving in Berlin in the mid-1990s, Herbst discovered an odour that had long disappeared from the streets of western cities, where -- unlike in the ex-communist east -- domestic coal burning had died out.The  ""heavy heat"" emanating from his stove suits his work as a writer too. ""I am always at my desk. I work from six o'clock in the morning to 10 at night sometimes,"" he says.Hans Engelke Energie supplies much of the coal used in the ovens across Berlin, and estimates between 5,000 to 6,000 homes still rely on the retro heat source.The family-run business is one of the last in Berlin still delivering briquettes of black coal to customers.It has had to diversify over recent years to survive, and now delivers home heating oil and wood pellets.""We sell gas and electricity, too,"" says company co-head Peter Engelke, adding that the company  ""hopes to prosper for a long time"".Germany's new government, which took office this month, has made the battle against climate change a priority, announcing a target to phase out the use of coal by 2030.Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition has pledged to expand renewable energy and decrease reliance on sources such as Russian gas in the long run.Some Berlin residents have already made the shift at home.Graphic designer Robert Schumann, who lives in the east of the city, still uses his ceramic stove to heat his home, but has dropped the coal in favour of wood.""It's more ecological,"" he says, drawing a comparison with fossil fuels excavated from the earth.""Less ash, and it's a more sustainable energy source because trees grow back.""",business
180,"After a decade-long hiatus, Russia is relaunching an ambitious bid for dominion over the world's budding space tourism industry, jostling with zealous billionaires, the United States, and rising China.Russia flaunted its comeback this month dispatching two cosmic adventurers -- Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and his assistant -- to the International Space Station (ISS) in its first launch of tourists in 12 years.Buoyed by the success, firebrand space chief Dmitry Rogozin talked up Russia's next steps to supremacy: a special module at the ISS for Russia's visitors, spacewalks outside the station, and -- down the line -- trips around the moon. ""We will not give this niche to the Americans. We are ready to fight for it,"" he told reporters at a press conference as Maezawa was blasting towards the ISS on a 12-day mission.Yet Russia's path to industry dominance is dotted with new obstacles that have emerged since it was last in the game a decade ago.Back then, the Russian space agency Roscosmos had a monopoly on sending the cash-flushed curious to space. That changed when US agency NASA retired its own shuttle for astronauts in 2011 and snatched up every seat to the ISS Roscosmos had on offer for the next decade.Then, last year, billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX barged onto the scene with its first successful ISS mission and NASA dropped Roscosmos.At a reported $90 million per seat, this was a huge financial blow to the cash-strapped Russian space agency, hit simultaneously with budget cuts and corruption scandals.Analysts say Roscosmos has no choice but to turn to tourism to cover the shortfall. ""The Russian space industry is reliant on consistent orders for these launches,"" industry analyst Vitaly Yegorov told AFP.The price tag for one seat -- estimated at $50-60 million -- covers the cost of building the three-person Soyuz spacecraft to shuttle the crew, he said, while a second traveller turns a profit. But space tourism is not just about the money, officials say.""It's national prestige. It gets young people interested in manned spaceflight. It's the future, after all,"" says Dmitry Loskutov, head of Glavkosmos -- a subsidiary of Roscosmos responsible for commercial projects, including tourism.Russia, China and the United States are the only countries capable of manned flights, but a slew of newcomers are entering the scene and forcing Russia to step up its game, SpaceX among them.Musk has yet to take tourists to the ISS, but this year his Inspiration4 brought an all-civilian crew into Earth's orbit on a three-day mission.Also eager for a cut are Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin Galactic of billionaire Richard Branson. Both their spacecrafts completed maiden voyages this year, remaining several minutes in zero gravity before returning to Earth.But Andrei Ionin of the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics says you just can't compare the billionaires' brief, low-orbit flights to a days-long mission to the ISS. ""It's like comparing the Ferrari and the Renault market,"" he said.Loskutov echoed the point, saying the trips were more a part of the  ""entertainment industry"" than the space travel.Still, Yegorov said,  ""competition is heating up,"" particularly from SpaceX. Russia has taken note. It wants to expand offerings, including a spacewalk during an upcoming tourist mission, Loskutov said.Moscow has also unveiled plans for its own orbital station with the ISS set to retire in the next decade and Rogozin has said there could be a  ""separate tourist module"" on board.He raised the possibility of new routes, following, for example, the path of the first human in space Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.Rogozin has also said that after 2030 Roscosmos hoped to offer a trip around the moon.But that timeline falls far behind SpaceX ambitions -- it has announced a mission to take eight people around the moon as early as 2023.Another complication Roscosmos faces in the sector is assessing and meeting demand.For one, Soyuz spacecraft are expensive and a mission takes at least two years to organise.Loskutov said Russia has pre-ordered a rocket for the next launch and Rogozin instructed his agency to boost its Soyuz production.Real demand -- not just interest -- is hard to assess too.Candidates must be willing to shell out, meet health requirements and commit to months of training and a rehabilitation period after returning to Earth. ""In my opinion, there aren't a lot of people -- but you don't need many, anyway,"" Ionin said.At least for now, he said, Russia is ahead thanks to the Soviet-designed and time-tested Soyuz. ""For the next five to 10 years, there is no threat to the business of Roscosmos,"" Ionin added.",business

190,"Instagram currently has over 2 billion monthly active users, reports CNBC, citing an anonymous employee of the social media platform who reportedly leaked the information.This information still warrants confirmation, but likely will not be officially announced anytime soon, as neither Facebook nor Instagram, social media sites owned by Meta, are known for disclosing official information regarding yearly finance and active user count.The last time such information was publicly disclosed was back in June 2018, where Instagram was announced to have reached over 1 billion monthly active users.Experts suggest this is a key milestone for Instagram, especially considering the backlash the company has faced recently.On 8 December, Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, was called to Congress to testify for the app's security concerns, especially regarding content management for its younger users.During the testimony, Mosseri stated that he is proud of how Instagram has kept younger users safe. This statement contrasted the US lawmakers' notion that Instagram is harmful to teens and the company hasn't done enough to promote a healthy and safe platform.TikTok, Instagram's rival app, announced in September that it reached 1 billion monthly active users. While Instagram had a head start in user count, the competition is still going strong.A survey by the global research company Forrester states that in 2021, 57% of US citizens aged from 12 to 17 used Instagram on a weekly basis. To compare with Instagram's rival app, TikTok garnered 63% users in the same demographic. Statistics by Sensor Tower show that TikTok has also beaten Instagram in overall downloads this year in Apple and Google devices, reaching 596.1 million global installations versus Instagram's 570.7 million.",tech_news
191,"Nike joined the wave of brands buying into excitement over virtual goods Monday as the sportswear giant announced it has bought RTFKT, a company that makes digital sneakers. RTFKT -- pronounced 'artefact' -- sells digital items in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), virtual assets that are authenticated using the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies. ""This acquisition is another step that accelerates Nike's digital transformation and allows us to serve athletes and creators at the intersection of sport, creativity, gaming and culture,"" said Nike CEO John Donahoe.Nike said the terms of the acquisition would not be disclosed. But the purchase reflects growing interest from big brands in NFTs.In May, an NFT of a Gucci handbag sold online for more than the real version would cost. The clamour over virtual goods comes over feverish predictions that the 'metaverse' -- a virtual reality version of the internet -- will eventually replace the web of today. Retail is one sector that could be transformed, with shoppers perhaps eventually donning virtual reality goggles to examine 3D replicas of real clothes. Nike has already opened 'Nikeland', a virtual showroom on gaming platform Roblox, where visitors can dress their avatars in Nike clothes.Founded last year, RTFKT seized on a similarity between sneakers and NFTs: both are often coveted as collectable items. In March, RTFKT reportedly sold 600 pairs of physical sneakers for $3.1 million -- but the items promoted as having 'real' value were the NFT versions of the sneakers sold with each pair. ""We're excited to grow our brand which was fully formed in the metaverse,"" RTFKT co-founder Benoit Pagotto said in a statement released by Nike. NFTs have generated huge interest over the past year, with enthusiasts predicting they will become a widespread form of ownership. Sceptics say the concept is over-hyped, with some NFTs changing hands for hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.",tech_news
192,"According to the multinational financial service provider J. P. Morgan, the upcoming iPhone SE 5G can potentially bring over a billion Android users to Apple.  The company is expected to launch the iPhone SE with 5G capabilities in early 2022, according to media reports and the brokerage, with the analysts adding the model will allow Apple to target the mid-range smartphone market dominated by rivals such as Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies.The upcoming smartphone has the potential to lure nearly 1.4 billion low- to mid-end Android phones and about 300 million older iPhone model users, the brokerage estimated.""Apple's trade-in program for non-iPhones is admittedly not as attractive as the iPhone trade-in values, it could nonetheless lead to an average starting price range of $269 to $399 for the 5G iPhone SE, which is still very competitive,"" analyst Samik Chatterjee, rated five stars on Refinitiv Eikon for his estimate accuracy, said.The iPhone SE currently starts from $399, compared with $799 for the iPhone 13 and $999 for the iPhone 13 Pro.Since launching the iPhone 13 range and new iPads in September, Apple has scrambled to keep up with the global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions.Meanwhile, Apple's shares have extended their march, with the company inching closer to the $3 trillion in market capitalization. On a separate note, J.P.Morgan said consumer demand for major upgrades like 5G models is expected to remain strong and also a priority for supply, even as it wanes for most hardware products including smartphones, TVs and PCs.The brokerage raised its estimates for fiscal 2022 iPhone SE unit sales to 30 million units and annual iPhone shipments expectations to 250 million units, 10 million higher than a year earlier.JPM raised its target price for Apple to a Street high of $210 from $180, according to Refinitiv Eikon.",tech_news
193,"Yesterday, Time Magazine announced the latest entry to their 'Person of the Year' recognition: the billionaire space entrepreneur and CEO at SpaceX and Tesla Inc., Elon Musk. According to Time, Elon Musk exemplarily represented the changing shifts in technology this year and helped people all over the globe with his innovative ideas. Musk -- who overtook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos this year to become the world's wealthiest person -- wields impact on Earth with his Tesla electric car company and beyond our planet with his SpaceX rockets.  ""Musk's rise coincides with broader trends of which he and his fellow technology magnates are part cause and part effect,"" Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote.Among those trends, Felsenthal listed ""the continuing decline of traditional institutions in favour of individuals; government dysfunction that has delivered more power and responsibility to business and chasms of wealth and opportunity. ""Time editors have previously defined the title -- which last year went to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris -- as going to people who ""embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse."" In October, Musk's electric car company's valuation soared above a trillion dollars, and SpaceX has teamed up with US space agency NASA to launch various missions including a test run of protecting Earth from an asteroid. The brash South African-born 50-year-old has seen his wealth soar during the pandemic to over $250 billion, according to Forbes' real-time billionaires list. He has also courted controversy with his provocative Twitter feed that can attack, joke and provoke -- including a poll in November asking Twitter whether he should sell a 10% share of his Tesla stock.Felsenthal noted Musk's provocative vision is accompanied by a persona that is a  ""blunt instrument that often seems to revel in division and aggressive mockery as he gives the world access to his id through social media."" Musk has appeared ever-present in American culture in recent years, amassing 66 million Twitter followers and guest-hosting the famed late-night comedy show Saturday Night Live in May. Musk speaks ambitiously about his interest in colonizing Mars and plans orbital flights next year as part of SpaceX's planned American return to the Moon. ""The goal overall has been to make life multi-planetary and enable humanity to become a spacefaring civilization,"" Musk told Time in an interview released with the Person of the Year announcement. ""SpaceX is starting a program to take CO2 out of the atmosphere; turn it into rocket fuel. Please join if interested,"" he tweeted later Monday, in an announcement that was as eye-catching as it was short of detail.Musk has also been known to move markets and the value of cryptocurrencies with a single tweet, but his main terrestrial influence, for now, is with his electric vehicles. ""Our intent with Tesla was always that we would serve as an example to the car industry, and hope that they also make electric cars so that we can accelerate the transition to sustainable energy,"" Musk told Time.Time notes that in an earlier era interplanetary travel was a collective undertaking that leaders used to rally their nations, but that increasingly private companies are involved. ""To Musk, that is progress, steering capital allocation away from the government to those who will be good stewards of it,"" Felsenthal wrote. ""To others, it is testament to capitalism's failings as staggeringly wealthy, mostly white men play by their own rules while much of society gets left behind,"" he added. ",tech_news
194,"The new Honda Civic for 2022 is out, welcoming the 11th generation on their lineup which could almost be taken for an Accord; from a certain distance and after squinting hard enough. The new Civic debuts new body styling, interior design and features both in terms of driver aid and infotainment. This week, we got our hands on one and we finally got to drive the car. Keep reading to find out what more the new Honda Civic has to offer.The new bits The new 11th gen Civic comes completely refreshed, with a new plaid design and interior bits and pieces where the Civic comes in four different packages sporting two different engine options; a 2L which comes in the base model and a 1.5L turbocharged made available for the higher trim levels. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.            Our test mule was an EX package with the 1.5L version which is, ironically the only version available (including the EX touring package, of course) in Bangladesh as the base model comes with a 2L, which also has less power compared to the turbo and due to our taxation system, which is solely based on engine capacity, the base model will end up costing more than the top of the line Civic available. A couple of other things to note is that the sedan version of the Civic does not offer a manual gearbox, it comes standard with a CVT; although if a manual transmission is absolutely necessary, there's the SI version available. Exterior; a new generation The exterior of the 11th gen Civic receives a dramatic design change which in retrospect, eliminates drama that was present in the last, introducing us to a new simpler, mature design language with easy to read straight body lines which end on the LED headlights with running DRLs, where the LEDs are a standard option through the whole lineup, even when it comes to the taillights.           Interior and infotainment Jump inside the Civic and you will find everything well laid out in the right positions and since the car is targeted towards heavy commuters in general, Honda did not overcomplicate the knobs and buttons which the driver or the passengers will interact with. Expect satisfactory materials used throughout the interior but since it's a Civic and not an Accord; do not expect Honda giving out genuine leather on the seats and wooden trim pieces. The seats in the Civic are roomy and although they are made of fabric, they come heated; and are manually operated, which is a bit of a bummer, but they still get the job well done. As far as the climate control goes, it's controlled with a bunch of knobs where the air comes through a honeycomb mesh sandwiched between the infotainment system screen and the AC controls, which gets cold enough to tackle Dhaka weathers.           What sets apart the Civic from the bigger Accord is the obvious cost-cutting done from Honda. For example, the Piano black Trim pieces on the front doors of our test car had a light bar going in the middle of the piece but the rear doors do not have it, but that is just me being nitpicky. The back seats though are amazing for a commuter. They are comfortable and have enough legroom where you can stretch your legs and your knees will not touch the front seat. There's also an armrest with cup holders in the middle which also adds up as an extra seat when folded up. Another feature which the new Civic has and I would like to see implemented in other cars as well as the feature to fold the seats directly from the boot of the car, which is a foolproof feature and contributes to extra convenience.           The infotainment system, on the other hand, has quite a lot to offer while maintaining simplicity; yet another effort from Honda not to overcomplicate what the user will interact with. It comes 7'' standard but it can be upgraded to a 9'' which usually comes in the LX package as standard. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also come standard which is always good to see. The sound is delivered through pairs of Bose speakers for the first time in a Civic, where the mids are well pronounced which makes the sound clear but it lacks a bit around the low end; the bass could be just a bit more satisfying but in the end, the mids make a satisfactory cut. Driving the Civic When you push the start button and finally start to drive the car, a noticeable feature is how visible everything is on the road and how open the ambience feels, mostly due to the sunroof, which allows a lot of light to enter inside the car which is always appreciated. Driving the actual car, the suspension in the Civic is brilliantly set where it takes small bumps at ease. The steering feels athletic where there is actual feedback when taking corners. The throttle response is great where the 1.5L turbo does not feel laggy and for a commuter, the 180hp and 240 Nm torque is plenty to feather with.           What intrigued Ahbaar Milky (in his own words) the most was how hard the CVT, when in sport mode, actually tried and successfully pretended to simulate 'gear shifts' akin to a DCT, albeit a sluggish one at that. Flick the drive mode selector downwards once and the digital cluster greets you with a dash of red, unlocking the joys of rowing through five simulated gears through the flappy paddles, which are ergonomically positioned just where your index fingers would grip the wheel when the hands are at 9 and 3. The paddles are tactile enough, having the same resistance and feel as the R1 and L1 buttons of a PlayStation controller, or a keyboard. Expect horrible economy on sport mode, obviously, as the CVT forces the engine to work overtime with instant throttle response if you're lead-footed. On the contrary, Normal and Economy modes do a solid job of keeping the drive experience seamless for hypermiling.           Verdict The new Civic is a great 'people's car' and it's the smallest details that make it just a bit more desirable all around. Driving the car does not feel like a chore and honestly, the whole package just makes sense. Although the E-Parking brake is the only thing that people could find annoying as it's small and the existence can easily slip off the dome (it happened twice with us). Coupled with the fantastic dampening on bumpy Dhaka roads, and the no-nonsense yet bang up to date interior, the new civic is already leagues ahead of the previous generation in our book. We just wish the wireless Apple CarPlay would work without any glitches on our test vehicle. There's a wireless charging pad though which worked with no hiccups.

195,"Many people are passionate about climate change, but not everybody should drive a battery electric vehicle as a means to combat climate change, Toyota Motor Corp Chief Scientist Gill Pratt said on Thursday at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit.Pratt's comments, during a discussion on electric vehicles, appeared to amplify remarks made over the past year by Toyota President Akio Toyoda.Toyota and other company officials have said that electric vehicles will play a greater role in reducing emissions, but other solutions should be used, Toyota's gasoline-electric hybrid models or hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles.At Thursday's conference, Pratt said Toyota believes in ""diversity of drivetrains"" to give customers different tools to reduce CO2.""It's not for us to predict which solution is the best or say only this will work,"" he said.Government incentives should be aimed at reducing carbon emissions, not picking which car technology is the best way to achieve those goals, Pratt added, in a reference to proposed bans on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, including hybrids, as a means of achieving carbon neutrality.Toyota was among major automakers that supported the Trump administration in its attempt to bar California from setting its own zero-emission requirements, but the company dropped that support earlier this year. Toyota has said it plans to invest $13.5 billion through 2030 on EV batteries, but so far its plans to roll out new battery electric vehicles (BEVs) seem relatively modest compared with those of US automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, which are spending around $30 billion each through 2025 to electrify more of their vehicle lines. Toyota executives continue to tout the merits of the company's hybrid vehicles, which have been on the market for more than 20 years.",tech_news

197,"Mercedes-Benz, the German company founded by the inventors of the motor car, is pouring more resources into its cutting-edge research and design capabilities in China as the centre of gravity of the new auto world shifts eastwards.In a drive to create a  ""home away from home"", Mercedes-Benz is doubling down on bases in Beijing and Shanghai to stay ahead of regulations and consumer trends in a car market that outstrips the United States and Germany combined.Three years after initially announcing plans to strengthen its research and development (R&D) in the country, the luxury car brand owned by Daimler will unveil its new Tech Center China in Beijing this month.Reuters has spoken to four people close to the tech centre and the brand's Chinese design studio who are familiar with the company's new China strategy. All declined to be named because they are not allowed to speak with the media.With 1,000 engineers, the new tech centre is more than three times the size of the one Mercedes-Benz opened in 2014 and the first outside Germany that can test  ""everything"", putting it more ""on par"" technically with the far bigger R&D headquarters near Stuttgart, a person close to the centre said.Mercedes-Benz has also invested significantly in upgrading its Chinese design studio and has moved the whole team from Beijing to Shanghai, a megalopolis of about 25 million people known as the car design capital of China.Mercedes-Benz has good reason to elevate its Chinese operations.Its car sales in China jumped 12% last year to a record 774,000 despite the pandemic, streets ahead of its next two markets, Germany on 286,000 and the United States with 275,000.  About 80% of the cars it sold in China were also made there, typically with an array of China-only features and models, and Asia overall accounted for almost half its global sales in 2021.China's auto market, the biggest in the world since 2009, is expected to carry on growing steadily, with demand forecast to reach 35 million vehicles by about 2030 versus 25 million now.'SECOND HOME'  But Mercedes-Benz, like all foreign automakers in China, is under growing pressure from local EV startups such as Xpeng, Li Auto and Nio and their stylish vehicles with high-tech features tailored to Chinese consumers.That's why the German carmaker's  ""second home"" strategy for China is focused on making its design and technology more agile, responding quickly to the ever-shifting landscape and to firmly entrench the Mercedes-Benz brand, the four sources said.""The expectations in China are for the in-car experience to be served by a localised digital services ecosystem, and such solutions must be conceived and built by people that live in China and truly understand the mobile internet,"" Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai, said.Mercedes-Benz customers in China are 36 years old on average - roughly 20 years younger than in Germany - and are more tech-savvy, but they are also notoriously disloyal, hopping from brand to brand as trends shift.Mercedes has spent 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million) upgrading the centre, with much of the investment ensuring it can do an array of testing locally - rather than send new technologies back to the Sindelfingen headquarters in Germany.""A key reason for the expansion is to gain the proximity to those customers and their needs,"" the person close to the tech centre said.  ""Here, we finally have everything we need to test the car fully,"" said the source.The centre has modern chassis test benches and others including for noise, vibration and harshness, as well as batteries and e-drive powertrains and it has the flexibility to swap in new ones as technology develops, two sources said.Mercedes has also added functions deemed important for Chinese customers, such as a team dedicated to intelligent, connected electric vehicle (EV) technology.""Tech-savvy customers here require that you're very local in terms of intelligence, connectivity and autonomous driving,"" one of the sources said.THINK ROSE GOLD  All four sources said a sharper focus on the customer in China in recent years is already paying off.A drive to create China-only colours led to research into the preferences of younger luxury goods buyers. While sensitive to being seen as hip and tech-savvy, there has been a revived interest in styles inspired by China's ancient dynasties.As part of that research, the studio came up with ""rose gold metallic"", a variation on rose gold tones adjusted for cars first used as an exterior colour for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class L sedan in 2018. New EVs such as the EQA and EQB now come in rose gold, and it's also an interior tone in the EQC.""Global ideas, inspired by China,"" said one source close to the studio, adding that while Mercedes needs to cater to its China customers first, some China-grown ideas will go global.Moving the studio to Shanghai was partly driven by the need to significantly speed up the design process by making it more digital, as most virtual model-making vendors are based there.""Besides, Shanghai is a lot easier a place to recruit design talent,"" said the source close to the studio, which is just north of the city's prime waterfront district The Bund.Designers typically sketch a car on paper or a touch-sensitive computer screen and expert modellers then help sculpt the designs into clay models. Mercedes-Benz plans to more or less do away with those physical models.Under the new process, the Shanghai studio will review its designs using virtual tools, except for the occasional quarter-size physical models, according to one of the four sources.If the studio makes it to the final of internal competitions for car designs, it will send designers and modellers to the main studio in Germany to create life-size models for the last round, the source said.RULES OF THE ROAD  Daimler's drive to strengthen its technology development in China also comes at a time when the cost of failing to be in step with Beijing policymakers has never been higher.Beijing's sweeping regulatory crackdown in recent months has wiped billions of dollars off the value of some of the country's best-known private firms and has weighed on the auto sector.That's partly because tensions between the United States and China have created a tricky environment for foreign companies to import technology developed elsewhere.And from battery technology to new kinds of mobility including smart connectivity and autonomous driving, Chinese policies and regulations are shifting and evolving rapidly.""If you respond to change after policies and regulation kick in, it's too late,"" said one of the contacts close to Daimler.With that in mind, the tech centre works closely with the brand's external affairs team which keeps its finger on the regulatory pulse - and that has proved key when it comes to so-called vehicle-to-everything, or V2X, technology.V2X controls communications between a car and  ""everything"" outside, from 5G cellular signals to low-earth-orbit satellites to smart traffic lights and cameras on the road.In China, vehicles will soon have to come with full-fledged V2X capabilities to achieve a top safety ranking under a new version of its vehicle safety evaluation system, or New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which is expected in 2025.""We knew this regulation was going to be implemented. We started developing those self-drive technologies including V2X to be in compliance with the new law and did so well before new regulation kicks in,"" one of the tech centre sources said.

202,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today called for ensuring easy transfer of available technologies to developing nations so that they can face the toughest challenges of the 4th industrial revolution (4IR) in keeping pace with the developed countries.Joining virtually the closing ceremony of a conference on the 4IR from her official Gono Bhaban residence in Dhaka, she said her government has been taking various time-befitting policies and measures to face the upcoming challenges of the 4IR.The University Grants Commission (UGC) arranged the two-day international conference on the 4th Industrial Revolution at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre from December 10, marking the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the golden jubilee of country's independence.The prime minister said that the world is divided into two over creating affordable and green value-chains as rich nations invent technologies and enjoy their utility, and other countries are unable to invest in them.She added that scientists believe that humans will have to coexist with artificial intelligence in near future and some new challenges have to be tackled.""For example, machines will shrink the human workplace, demand for cheap labour will decrease, inequality will increase, and migration will be encouraged. Foreign investment in developing countries will reduce, and inequality in technological know-how will increase,"" she continued.The premier said that the 4th Industrial Revolution International Conference is a landmark step for development in Bangladesh.Industrialisation aims to improve the quality of life, create a market for new products, and accelerate the pace of economy through employment, she said.The premier added that the groundbreaking evolution of industrialisation after almost 100 consecutive years is remarkable. ""Passing the first, second, and third stages, we have reached the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution,"" she added.""I hope that the knowledge gained in this conference will create a strong rapport between our educational and industrial institutions. As a result, research and innovation related to the 4th Industrial Revolution will be easier to put into practice,"" she said.Since the formation of the government in 1996, she said, her government has focused on establishing IT infrastructure, formulating rules, and creating skilled citizens with technology.""We approved the establishment of 16 private universities and founded Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Bangabandhu Agricultural University. We started the work of setting up 12 science and technology universities. We established 15 polytechnic institutes and three women's polytechnic institutes,"" she told the function.The prime minister said they took effective measures by identifying 1,176 highly polluting industries and banned two-stroke three-wheelers since 1998. Her government has withdrawn duty on all agricultural machineries, she added.""We formulated up-to-date industrial policies to encourage the development of indigenous industries and investment. Intending to expand small and cottage industries, we established 57 industrial towns and started establishing another 13. In FY 2000-2001, we increased the power generation to 4,300 MW,"" she further said.She said the 1991-95 BNP regime refused to receive free fibre optic cable connections in Bangladesh. So, the country became isolated from global information technology highways, she added.""We formed the government and adopted new policies to develop this sector. We took the initiative to build IT-village and hi-tech park to develop software, data-entry, and data-processing industries. We allowed duty-free import of computers, computer parts, and software,"" she said.She said that they prepared the ground for the development of information technology by breaking the monopoly on mobile phones and V-SAT installations.The premier mentioned that in 1996, the number of mobile phones was only 2,000, and the price of each was more than 100 thousand taka. In 2001, the number of mobile telephones stood at around 700 thousand, and the average price was 7,000 taka.As a result, millions of people are employed to manufacture and assemble computer parts, make software, and do data processing, she added.The prime minister said they have been working to build a Digital Bangladesh by 2021 as well as to introduce innovative technology in the industrial sector. ""As a result, the number of internet users has now exceeded 120 million. We are launching 5-G Network Service soon.

204,"Rohingya refugees sued Facebook on Monday for $150 billion over claims the social network is failing to stem hate speech on its platform, exacerbating violence against the vulnerable minority.The complaint, lodged in a California court, says the algorithms that power the US-based company promote disinformation and extremist thought that translates to real-world violence.""Facebook is like a robot programmed with a singular mission: to grow,"" the court document states.""The undeniable reality is that Facebook's growth, fueled by hate, division, and misinformation, has left hundreds of thousands of devastated Rohingya lives in its wake.""The mainly Muslim group faces widespread discrimination in Myanmar, where they are despised as interlopers despite having lived in the country for generations.A military-backed campaign that the United Nations said amounted to genocide saw hundreds of thousands of Rohingya driven across the border into Bangladesh in 2017, where they have since lived in sprawling refugee camps.Many others remain in Myanmar, where they are not permitted citizenship and are subject to communal violence, as well as official discrimination by the ruling military junta.The legal complaint argues that Facebook's algorithms drive susceptible users to join ever-more extreme groups, a situation that is ""open to exploitation by autocratic politicians and regimes.""Rights groups have long charged that Facebook does not do enough to prevent the spread of disinformation and misinformation online.Critics say even when alerted to hate speech on its platform, the company fails to act.They charge that the social media giant allows falsehoods to proliferate, affecting the lives of minorities and skewing elections in democracies such as the United States, where unfounded charges of fraud circulate and intensify among like-minded friends.This year, a huge leak by a company insider sparked articles arguing Facebook, whose parent company is now called Meta, knew its sites could harm some of their billions of users -- but executives chose growth over safety.Whistleblower Frances Haugen told the US Congress in October that Facebook is ""fanning ethnic violence"" in some countries.Under US law, Facebook is largely protected from liability over content posted by its users.The Rohingya lawsuit, anticipating this defense, argues that where applicable, the law of Myanmar -- which has no such protections -- should prevail in the case.Facebook, which did not immediately respond to questions about the lawsuit, has been under pressure in the United States and Europe to clamp down on false information, particularly over elections and the coronavirus.The company has forged partnerships with several media companies, including AFP, intended to verify online posts and remove those that are untrue.",tech_news

They also often prioritise the professional over the personal helps in an American office culture of overwork, Gopalakrishnan adds.""These are characteristics of top leaders anywhere in the world,"" he says.India-born Silicon Valley CEOs are also part of a four million-strong minority group that is among the wealthiest and most educated in the US.About a million of them are scientists and engineers. More than 70 percent of H-1B visas -- work permits for foreigners -- issued by the US go to Indian software engineers, and 40 percent of all foreign-born engineers in cities like Seattle are from India, states the BBC report.""This is the result of a drastic shift in US immigration policy in the 1960s,"" according to the authors of ""The Other One Percent: Indians in America"".In the wake of the civil rights movement, national-origin quotas were replaced by those that gave preference to skills and family unification. Soon after, highly-educated Indians -- scientists, engineers and doctors at first, and then, overwhelmingly, software programmers -- began arriving in the US, BBC explains from the book.This cohort of Indian immigrants did not ""resemble any other immigrant group from any other nation,"" the authors say. They were ""triply selected"" -- not only were they among the upper-caste privileged Indians who could afford to go to a reputed college, but they also belonged to a smaller sliver that could finance a masters in the US, which many of Silicon Valley's CEOs possess. And finally, the visa system further narrowed it down to those with specific skills -- often in science, technology, engineering and maths or STEM as the preferred category is known -- that meet the US' ""high-end labour market needs"".""This is the cream of the crop and they are joining companies where the best rise to the top,"" reports BBC quoting technology entrepreneur and academic Vivek Wadhwa as explaining. ""The networks they have built [in Silicon Valley] have also given them an advantage - the idea was that they would help each other.""Wadhwa adds that many of the India-born CEOs have also worked their way up the company ladder -- and this, he believes, gives them a sense of humility that distinguishes them from many founder-CEOs who have been accused of being arrogant and entitled in their vision and management.Wadhwa says men like Nadella and Pichai also bring a certain amount of caution, reflection and a ""gentler"" culture that makes them ideal candidates for the top job -- especially at a time when big tech's reputation has plummeted amid Congressional hearings, rows with foreign governments and the widening gulf between Silicon Valley's richest and the rest of America.There are more obvious reasons as well. The fact that so many Indians can speak English makes it easier for them to integrate into the diverse US tech industry. And Indian education's emphasis on math and science has created a thriving software industry, training graduates in the right skills, which are further buttressed in top engineering or management schools in the US, BBC reports.",tech_news

213,"A wild crocodile in Indonesia who was trapped in a tyre for more than five years has been rescued, freed from its rubber vice and released back into the wild, officials and residents said Tuesday.Conservation workers have been trying to lure the stricken saltwater crocodile from a river since 2016 after residents of Palu city on Sulawesi island spotted the animal with a motorbike tyre wrapped around its neck.But it was a local resident who snared the 5.2-metre (17 foot) long reptile -- who was regularly seen sunbathing in the Palu river in Central Sulawesi -- from its tight squeeze late on Monday.Tili, a 34-year-old bird-seller, used chicken as bait and ropes to catch the beast at the end of what he said was a three-week rescue effort, before dozens of locals helped to drag the crocodile to shore and cut the tyre around its neck.""I just wanted to help, I hate seeing animals trapped and suffering,"" Tili, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told AFP.His first two attempts to rescue the croc failed because the ropes were not strong enough to contend with its weight, he said, before turning to nylon ropes used for tugging boats.""I was already exhausted so I let them finish the rescue, the crocodile was unbelievably heavy, everybody was sweating and getting very tired.""The crocodile was released back into the water immediately after the rescue to relieved cheers from locals.Conservationists believe someone may have deliberately placed the tyre around the croc's neck in a failed attempt to trap it as a pet in the archipelago nation that is home to several species of the animal.Tili beat the authorities to the capture because they lacked the proper equipment for a rescue in the river that houses more than 30 other crocodiles.""Yesterday was a historical day for us, we are grateful the crocodile was finally rescued and we appreciate the locals who showed concern for the wildlife,"" Hasmuni Hasmar, head of the local conservation agency, told AFP.The reptile made headlines in early 2020 when the local government promised a reward to anyone who caught the croc and removed the tyre, but later called off the contest over fears it could endanger its safety.But the local conservation agency said Tili is in line for a prize after his daring plan paid off.""We will award Tili for his effort in rescuing the wildlife,"" Hasmar said.",environment

215,"Plastic has infiltrated all parts of the ocean and is now found ""in the smallest plankton up to the largest whale"" wildlife group WWF said on Tuesday, calling for urgent efforts to create an international treaty on plastics.Tiny fragments of plastic have reached even the most remote and seemingly-pristine regions of the planet: it peppers Arctic sea ice and has been found inside fish in the deepest recesses of the ocean, the Mariana Trench.There is no international agreement in place to address the problem, although delegates meeting in Nairobi for a United Nations environment meeting this month are expected to launch talks on a worldwide plastics treaty.WWF sought to bolster the case for action in its latest report, which synthesises more than 2,000 separate scientific studies on the impacts of plastic pollution on the oceans, biodiversity and marine ecosystems.The report acknowledged that there is currently insufficient evidence to estimate the potential repercussions on humans.But it found that the fossil-fuel derived substance ""has reached every part of the ocean, from the sea surface to the deep ocean floor, from the poles to coastlines of the most remote islands and is detectable in the smallest plankton up to the largest whale"".'SATURATION POINT'According to some estimates, between 19 and 23 million tons of plastic waste is washed into the world's waterways every year, the WWF report said.This is largely from single-use plastics, which still constitute more than 60 percent of marine pollution, although more and more countries are acting to ban their use.""In many places (we are) reaching some kind of saturation point for marine ecosystems, where we're approaching levels that pose a significant threat,"" said Eirik Lindebjerg, Global Plastics Policy Manager at WWF.In some places there is a risk of ""ecosystem collapse"", he said.Many people have seen images of seabirds choking on plastic straws or turtles wrapped in discarded fishing nets, but he said the danger is across the entire marine food web.It ""will affect not only the whale and the seal and the turtle, but huge fish stocks and the animals that depend on those"", he added.In one 2021 study, 386 fish species were found to have ingested plastic, out of 555 tested.Separate research, looking at the major commercially fished species, found up to 30 percent of cod in a sample caught in the North Sea had microplastics in their stomach.Once in the water, the plastic begins to degrade, becoming smaller and smaller until it is a ""nanoplastic"", invisible to the naked eye.So even if all plastic pollution stopped completely, the volume of microplastics in the oceans could still double by 2050.But plastic production continues to rise, potentially doubling by 2040, according to projections cited by WWF, with ocean plastic pollution expected to triple during the same period.ENDURING RISKLindebjerg compares the situation to the climate crisis -- and the concept of a ""carbon budget"", that caps the maximum amount of CO2 that can be released into the atmosphere before a global warming cap is exceeded.""There is actually a limit to how much plastic pollution our marine ecosystems can absorb,"" he said.Those limits have already been reached for microplastics in several parts of the world, according to WWF, particularly in the Mediterranean, the Yellow and East China Seas (between China, Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula) and in the Arctic sea ice.""We need to treat it as a fixed system that doesn't absorb plastic, and that's why we need to go towards zero emissions, zero pollution as fast as possible,"" said Lindebjerg.WWF is calling for talks aimed at drawing up an international agreement on plastics at the UN environment meeting, from February 28 to March 2 in Nairobi.It wants any treaty to lead to global standards of production and real ""recyclability"".Trying to clean up the oceans is ""extremely difficult and extremely expensive"", Lindebjerg said, adding that it was better on all metrics not to pollute in the first place.",environment

Even so, 2021 was still warmer than previous years influenced by La Nina,"" WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in the statement.This, he said, shows that ""the overall long-term warming as a result of greenhouse gas increases is now far larger than the year-to-year variability in global average temperatures caused by naturally occurring climate drivers.""La Nina refers to the large-scale cooling of surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, with widespread impacts on weather around the world.The phenomenon, which typically has the opposite impacts as the warming El Nino phenomenon, usually occurs every two to seven years, but has now hit twice since 2020.WMO reached its conclusions by consolidating six leading international datasets, including the European Union's Copernicus climate monitor (C3S) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which announced similar findings last week.The datasets showed that the average global temperature in 2021 was around 1.11 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels measured between 1850 and 1900.'RECORD-SHATTERING TEMPERATURE'Last year also marked the seventh consecutive year that global temperatures were more than 1°C above pre-industrial levels, the datasets showed.""The global average temperature in 2021 is already approaching the lower limit of temperature increase the Paris Agreement seeks to avert,"" the WMO warned.The 2015 Paris Agreement saw countries agree to cap global warming at ""well below"" 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and 1.5°C if possible.The WMO stressed that the unbroken warm streak over the past seven years was part of a longer-term trend towards higher global temperatures.""Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one,"" it said.""This is expected to continue.""The datasets varied slightly in their assessment of where 2021 ranked among the seven warmest years, with C3S ranking it fifth, NOAA ranking it sixth, and others saying it was seventh.""The small differences among these datasets indicates the margin of error for calculating the average global temperature,"" the WMO said.But while 2021 was among the coolest of the top-seven hottest years, it was still marked by a range of record temperatures and extreme weather events linked to global warming.Taalas pointed to the ""record-shattering temperature of nearly 50C in Canada, comparable to the values reported in the hot Saharan Desert of Algeria, exceptional rainfall, and deadly flooding in Asia and Europe as well as drought in parts of Africa and South America.""""Climate change impacts and weather-related hazards had life-changing and devastating impacts on communities on every single continent.""",environment
226,"Tonga's massive underwater volcanic eruption could deliver long-lasting damage to coral reefs, erode coastlines and disrupt fisheries, say scientists studying satellite images and looking to the past to project the future of the remote region:ACID RAINSince the initial eruption, the volcano has been releasing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide — two gases that create acid rain when they interact with water and oxygen in the atmosphere.With Tonga's tropical climate, ""there is likely to be acid rain around Tonga for a while to come,"" said volcanologist Shane Cronin at the University of Auckland.Acid rain causes widespread crop damage, and could ruin Tongan staples like taro, corn, bananas and garden vegetables. ""Depending on how long the eruptions last, food security could be compromised,"" Cronin said.Satellite imagery shows the plume spreading westward, which means Tonga could be spared some of this acid rain though Fiji could then be in its path.In a bulletin on Monday, the U.N. humanitarian affairs office said Fiji was monitoring its air quality, and has advised people to cover their household water tanks and stay indoors in the event of rain.FISH DIE-OFFSTonga's exclusive economic zone of nearly 700,000 marine square kilometres (270,271 square miles) is 1,000 times larger than its land area. And most Tongans get their food — and livelihood — from the ocean.While scientists have yet to investigate on the ground, ""the few pictures that are available seem to show a blanket ... of ash"" on land, said Marco Brenna, a geologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand.In the ocean, that ash can be harmful to marine life. Weeks before Saturday's eruption, Tonga Geological Services had warned that nearby seawater was contaminated with toxic volcanic discharge, and that fishermen should ""assume fish in these waters are poisoned or poisonous.""Inevitably, the eruption has made the situation worse. Murky, ash-filled water near the volcano will deprive fish of food and wipe out spawning beds. Some fish will perish, and survivors will be forced to migrate, scientists said. Further changes in the structure of the sea floor could create new obstacles for fishing vessels.""It will be a while before the same or new fishing grounds will be restored,"" Brenna said.SMOTHERED CORALSFalling ash can also smother coral reefs, which in Tonga are the mainstay of a tourism industry that brought in up to $5 million per year before the coronavirus pandemic.Even before the eruption, Tonga's reefs were threatened by disease outbreaks and the effects of climate change including coral bleaching and increasingly strong cyclones.Now, ""vast areas of the reefs in the immediate impact area at Hunga Tonga are probably buried and smothered by large deposits of volcanic ash,"" said Tom Schils, a marine biologist at the University of Guam who has studied volcanic eruptions and corals in the Northern Mariana Islands.Such eruptions also release more iron into the water, which can boost the growth of blue-green algae and sponges that further degrade reefs.Reefs may have to start over - a process that could take years, said Brian Zgliczynski, a coral reef ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""Species more tolerant of poor water quality will arrive first,"" while hard corals and fish would take longer to return, he said.ERODED COASTLINES
A loss of coral reefs would also affect Tonga's ability to cope with rising waters and storm surges. This is a concern for Tonga, where climate change is driving the sea level to rise by about 6 millimeters (0.2 inches) per year — double the global average.
In a 2015 report, Tonga valued its natural storm buffers including coral reefs as well as coastal seagrasses and mangroves at some $11 million annually.
With the latest eruption, a Tongan sea level gauge recorded a tsunami wave of 1.19 metres (nearly four feet) before it stopped reporting. Tsunamis are known to cause rapid coastal erosion. And before communication systems went down, videos revealed damage to manmade seawalls.
""Coastal defences and reclaimed land could all be strongly impacted by the tsunami waves, leaving the islands more vulnerable,"" Cronin said.

231,"Birders may go through many phases in their birding life. In the ""waterfowl phase"" they look for ducks and other water birds. In the ""raptor phase"" they are searching for birds of prey. Some go through a ""wader phase"" visiting water bodies for birds that live on the mud around them. The other day I met a young, knowledgeable birder who is in an ""ID phase."" His mission is to find birds he has not seen before, identify them, and add them to the list of birds he has already observed.And then there is the ""little birds phase."" This is the phase when the birder is pulled by little birds in forests, groves and meadows. I am perpetually stuck in this phase since I love little birds.Let me illustrate with an example. My friend Niaz and I travel to Rajshahi looking for birds. We have wonderful luck finding birds (including a Comb Duck) on the Padma river. But we have heard of a Black Redstart, a beautiful but rare winter visitor, that dwells in Rajshahi University. On our last morning we go there with our guide and find the bird. It seems friendly enough at first but before we can get a decent photograph it gets spooked and flies to the roof of a three-story building. And it stays there. We wait and wait and finally give up. After all, there are other birds to chase in the chars of the Padma which runs close by.Later that afternoon, our Padma birding done, we check out of the hotel. We skip lunch and find ourselves with an extra hour before our flight. That redstart is on our minds. It is tugging at our hearts. On the way to the airport Niaz suggests stopping by the University. Maybe we will have better luck than we did in the morning.So we take the detour and find luck on our side. The handsome Redstart flies around in a well-tended garden, looking for small bugs. It drops to the ground, runs hither and thither, and swooshes up to perch on the posts supporting the flowering plants. It poses for us again and again.Not all little birds are so friendly. They have attracted and frustrated me from my start in birding. One reason that little birds – also known as songbirds or passerines – are attractive is their colour. Birds such as minivets, nuthatches, barbets, flycatchers and sunbirds dazzle with their hued plumage. The likelihood of finding a bird new to me is also higher with little birds. But finding, stalking and photographing a little bird to my satisfaction is difficult. Most of them live in forests where light is low. They move too quickly for my camera's autofocus. All too often they are fully or partially hidden by leaves and branches. And some birds – particularly minivets – seem to deliberately turn their head away from the camera. Still, watching them is delightful. With unpredictable movements and seemingly pointless frolicking, they get their food and move on. Compare that to watching a Great Egret standing on one leg waiting for a fish!However, while you will get a good photograph of the egret nine out of ten times, the odds are much worse in the case of a little bird. But, like elsewhere in life, we run after that which is hard to get. For the author's daily bird photos, please follow ""ihtishamkabir"" on Instagram.",environment

Gazipur has the most polluted air out of 64 districts in Bangladesh and Madaripur the least, found a recent study. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
The permissible limit set by the Department of Environment for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) -- which refers to the tiny particles or droplets in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated -- is 65 micrograms per cubic metre.
Gazipur's PM 2.5 level was found to be 263.51 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the study conducted by the Stamford University's Centre for Atmospheric Pollution Study last year on air quality from 3,163 spots across the country.
On average, Bangladesh's PM 2.5 level was 102.41 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the study, unveiled yesterday.
Professor Md Ahmed Kamruzzaman Majumder who led the study team of 81 said it was first ever study on air quality of 64 districts.
Other than the obvious respiratory ailments, high levels of PM 2.5 affect the kidney and liver too.
""In Bangladesh, kidney problem is becoming acute, with eight lakh patients currently requiring dialysis,"" said Lenin Chowdhury, a public health expert.
Gazipur was followed by Dhaka and Narayanganj respectively.
Hundreds of brick kilns, thousands of industries, excavation for development works, unfit vehicles, burning of wastage account for the high concentration of PM 2.5 in Gazipur, Dhaka and Narayanganj's air, the study said.
As many as 18 districts including Habiganj, Noakhali, Cox's Bazar and Moulvibazar have high levels of PM 2.5.
Madaripur, the district with the healthiest air quality in Bangladesh, had a PM of 49.08 micrograms per cubic metre thanks to thousands of water bodies, ponds, ditches and greenery.
Nine other districts have similar air quality including Kurigram, Natore, Rajshahi, Pabna, Sirajganj and Patuakhali.
As many as 36 districts including Jashore, Gopalganj, Narsingdi, Gaibandha, Rangamati and Cumilla have moderate air quality.
Among the divisional cities, Rajshahi performed the best with a PM 2.5 level of 56.41 micrograms per cubic metre and Dhaka the worst (252.93 micrograms per cubic metre).
The government organisations in charge of regulating the air quality have no accountability, Sharif Jamil, general secretary of the Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, told The Daily Star.
""Had it been there, they would have been brought to book for their failure and exposing the whole nation to high levels of air pollution.""
People's participation must be ensured in air quality monitoring mechanisms, he said, while calling for amendments to the environment law so that people can go to court for suffering from environmental hazards.
""And foreign companies working in development projects must comply with the environmental guidelines,"" Jamil added.
Air pollution affects the plants and wildlife, disturbing the ecological balance, said Mohammad Zashim Uddin, a professor at Dhaka University's botany department.
""We must take the crisis seriously to find a solution,"" he added.
The study also provided short-, mid- and long-term recommendations for mitigating the crisis.
Short-term actions include sprinkling water every two to three hours by Wasa and city corporations, ensuring construction materials are covered with tarpaulin, using suction trucks to remove dust, shutting down brick kilns and getting rid of unfit vehicles from the roads.
Mid-term actions comprise planting trees, initiating separate lanes for bicycles, conserving waterbodies and coordination among service providing agencies.
Long-term solutions include enacting the Clean Air Act, increasing the budgetary allocation for environment, forest and climate change ministry, setting up an air monitoring station and real-time air quality displays to provide timely air quality data for citizens, improving the traffic system and initiating environment cadre service.

Gazipur has the most polluted air out of 64 districts in Bangladesh and Madaripur the least, found a recent study.The permissible limit set by the Department of Environment for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) -- which refers to the tiny particles or droplets in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated -- is 65 micrograms per cubic metre.Gazipur's PM 2.5 level was found to be 263.51 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the study conducted by the Stamford University's Centre for Atmospheric Pollution Study last year on air quality from 3,163 spots across the country.On average, Bangladesh's PM 2.5 level was 102.41 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the study, unveiled yesterday.Professor Md Ahmed Kamruzzaman Majumder who led the study team of 81 said it was first ever study on air quality of 64 districts.Other than the obvious respiratory ailments, high levels of PM 2.5 affect the kidney and liver too.""In Bangladesh, kidney problem is becoming acute, with eight lakh patients currently requiring dialysis,"" said Lenin Chowdhury, a public health expert.Gazipur was followed by Dhaka and Narayanganj respectively.Hundreds of brick kilns, thousands of industries, excavation for development works, unfit vehicles, burning of wastage account for the high concentration of PM 2.5 in Gazipur, Dhaka and Narayanganj's air, the study said.As many as 18 districts including Habiganj, Noakhali, Cox's Bazar and Moulvibazar have high levels of PM 2.5.Madaripur, the district with the healthiest air quality in Bangladesh, had a PM of 49.08 micrograms per cubic metre thanks to thousands of water bodies, ponds, ditches and greenery.Nine other districts have similar air quality including Kurigram, Natore, Rajshahi, Pabna, Sirajganj and Patuakhali.As many as 36 districts including Jashore, Gopalganj, Narsingdi, Gaibandha, Rangamati and Cumilla have moderate air quality.Among the divisional cities, Rajshahi performed the best with a PM 2.5 level of 56.41 micrograms per cubic metre and Dhaka the worst (252.93 micrograms per cubic metre).The government organisations in charge of regulating the air quality have no accountability, Sharif Jamil, general secretary of the Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, told The Daily Star.""Had it been there, they would have been brought to book for their failure and exposing the whole nation to high levels of air pollution.""People's participation must be ensured in air quality monitoring mechanisms, he said, while calling for amendments to the environment law so that people can go to court for suffering from environmental hazards.""And foreign companies working in development projects must comply with the environmental guidelines,"" Jamil added.Air pollution affects the plants and wildlife, disturbing the ecological balance, said Mohammad Zashim Uddin, a professor at Dhaka University's botany department.""We must take the crisis seriously to find a solution,"" he added.The study also provided short-, mid- and long-term recommendations for mitigating the crisis.Short-term actions include sprinkling water every two to three hours by Wasa and city corporations, ensuring construction materials are covered with tarpaulin, using suction trucks to remove dust, shutting down brick kilns and getting rid of unfit vehicles from the roads.Mid-term actions comprise planting trees, initiating separate lanes for bicycles, conserving waterbodies and coordination among service providing agencies.Long-term solutions include enacting the Clean Air Act, increasing the budgetary allocation for environment, forest and climate change ministry, setting up an air monitoring station and real-time air quality displays to provide timely air quality data for citizens, improving the traffic system and initiating environment cadre service.",environment
234,"Prof Dr Ahmad Kamruzzaman Majumder, director of the Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies at Stamford University, this morning revealed a survey report on which district has the worst air pollution.According to the report, Gazipur district has the most polluted air in the country, while Madaripur has the cleanest air.The press conference was held at the National Press Club in Dhaka.The information was collected through a survey in 63 districts across the country.According to the survey report, Dhaka district ranks second in terms of air pollution, while Narayanganj ranks third.Gazipur has the most pollution due to a variety of factors such as road digging, various projects, brick kilns, and concentration of industrial factories.The highest level of air pollution that can be accepted as normal is 65 micrograms per cubic meter. Gazipur's air quality is 263 micrograms per cubic meter.This value is 49 micrograms in Madaripur. Madaripur's air quality has been described as good, owing to the abundance of water bodies, rivers, and greenery.",environment

237,"Residents of the capital have inhaled clean air for only 38 days in the last six years, found a study, highlighting the gravity of the air pollution that over two crore people of the city are exposed to every day.The alarming figures came up in a study conducted by Stamford University's Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies from 2016 to 2021.For the last six years, the average AQI (Air Quality Index) scores in Dhaka was 219, which falls in the category of extremely unhealthy, the report said. The permissible limit of clean air is AQI 0-50.Dust generated from development work contributes 30 percent to air pollution, while about 29 percent of due to industries and brick kilns.Ambient air pollution accounts for an estimated 4.2 million deaths globally per year. They die from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer as well as acute and chronic respiratory diseases.The report, released yesterday, also stated that nights in Dhaka provide little relief from the pollution. ""It was found that nighttime is riskier for residents than daytime, as the air quality nosedives at night due to multiple factors.""The reasons include trucks carrying construction materials and inter-district buses entering the city at night, city corporation workers sweeping the roads during that time, and the dip in temperature that allows dust to hang in the air for a longer time.From 2020-21, air pollution has increased by 9.8 percent, the report stated, adding that it was mainly due to economic activities getting back on track after Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed.Professor Ahmed Kamruzzaman Majumder, chairperson of Stamford University's environmental science department, who led the study, told The Daily Star that Dhaka's air starts deteriorating from 4:00pm, and pollution peaks around 2:00am.""The air quality is better after 2:00am till 6:00am. Then it dips again from 6:00am to 9:00am, as office and school-goers hit the streets,"" he said at a press conference organised by Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa) in the city yesterday.Taking part in the discussion, Bapa General Secretary Sharif Jamil said Dhaka's AQI was above 300 on 37 days of the last six years, which is seriously hazardous for people.""Under Environment Conservation Act-1995, when air quality deteriorates to such a level, the department of environment [DoE] must issue a warning to residents about this health hazards. We never saw any such notice or warning from it, which indicates their sheer negligence,"" he said.He also alleged that foreign companies that are executing the country's mega projects do not comply with environmental guidelines, disregarding people's health.The Daily Star called Ashraf Uddin, director general of DoE, and Md Asadul Haque, director (Dhaka metropolitan) of DoE for their comments. They did not receive the calls nor replied to texts.The High Court on November 24 last year issued nine instructions to DoE, two city corporations and BRTA to make sure that waste-carrying vehicles, construction materials and construction sites are covered with tarpaulin, and that water is sprinkled on streets.According to a World Bank study, air pollution kills 10,000 people in Dhaka alone every year, while 1,53,000 people die across the country.",environment
238,"Despite a valiant effort from opener Tamim Iqbal, Minister Group Dhaka suffered an agonising three-run defeat against Chattogram Challengers as the ongoing Bangabandhu Bangladesh Premier League produced one of the most exciting fixtures of this edition in Sylhet today.Tamim's unbeaten 56-ball 73, alongside useful contributions from Dhaka skipper Mahmudullah Riyad and all-rounder Shuvagata Hom, took the game right down till the final delivery. However, Dhaka still fell short as they could score 145 for six while chasing a 149-run target set by Chattogram. The victory helped Chattogram bounce back to winning ways after three successive defeats in the tournament. Chasing a somewhat competitive total, Dhaka were in a precarious situation as they lost three for just 21 in 4.2 overs. The experienced duo of Tamim and Mahmudullah then consolidated brilliantly, stitching a 71-run fourth-wicket stand off just 59 deliveries to keep Dhaka's hopes alive. After starting slowly, both Tamim and Mahmudullah had begun to dominate proceedings and at one point it looked like Dhaka would get over the line almost with ease. However, things changed when Shamim Hossain, who had earlier scored a valuable fifty to help Chattogram get to a competitive total, produced a brilliant fielding effort to remove Mahmudullah in the 15th over. Mahmudullah's slog-sweep off Mehedi Hasan Miraz was headed towards the boundary but Shamim covered decent ground in the deep and took a brilliant catch on the run. He showed impeccable presence of mind, throwing the ball to Benny Howell before he ran over the fence. Howell did not fail to grab the ball as the duo completed a brilliant assisted catch on the boundary.  After Mahmudullah's departure following a 29-ball 24, Tamim carried on and stitched another quick-fire 43-run stand with Shuvagata. Shuvagata played an 11-ball 22-run cameo, laced with two boundaries and a maximum, but departed in the penultimate over to Shoriful Islam after hitting the bowler for a six in the very first ball to take the equation down to 14 off just 11 deliveries. And had it been Tamim on strike from the first ball of the final over, the result could have been a bit different as the southpaw looked to be in phenomenal rhythm having already hit six fours and three maximums during a boundary-laden innings. However, with Tamim left stranded at the non-striker's end for the first four deliveries, pacer Mrittunjoy Chowdhury ended up bowling a brilliant final over to help Chattogram register a thrilling win. And the one delivery that Tamim faced in the final over, he had to deal with a brilliant yorker by Mrittunjoy that only led to a single run.Earlier, after being asked to bat, Chattogram got off to an abrupt start as they lost opener Zakir Hasan early. Will Jacks and Chattogram's new captain Afif Hossain, who was only made captain just ahead of the game as the franchise dropped the previous skipper Naeem Islam citing his poor form, then put on a steady 40-run stand. It was however Shamim's 37-ball 52 alongside Benny Howell's unbeaten 24 that helped Chattogram end up with a decent total after they had lost three quick wickets in the middle.

239,"Ralf Rangnick blamed a lack of aggression for Manchester United's failure to beat bottom-of-the-table Burnley as a 1-1 draw at Turf Moor saw the Red Devils fall out of the Premier League's top four.With Cristiano Ronaldo left on the bench, United were made to pay for not making more of a dominant first 45 minutes after Paul Pogba put them in front.Burnley roared back after the break and gave their survival hopes a boost when Jay Rodriguez levelled two minutes into the second half.West Ham's 1-0 win over Watford sees the Hammers leapfrog United into the final slot to qualify for next season's Champions League, while Arsenal and Tottenham remain within striking distance with games in hand.""Again it's a frustrating night for us because we should have won that game easily,"" said Rangnick.""The first 15-20 minutes of the second half we were just not aggressive enough. One point from a performance like this is just not enough.""United's troubled season hit another bump in the road when they were dumped out of the FA Cup by Championship side Middlesbrough on penalties on Friday.The lessons from that defeat were not learned as again Rangnick's men had more than enough chances to kill the game as a contest before half-time before being punished for a slack piece of defending.For the first time the German left a fit Ronaldo out of his starting line-up for a league match after the 37-year-old played the full 120 minutes on Friday.However, United's first half performance will add more fuel to the debate on whether they function better as a unit without the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.The visitors had the ball in the net three times and missed a number of guilt-edged chances, but only had one goal to show for their dominance by half-time.Raphael Varane thought he had scored his first United goal when he leapt to power home Bruno Fernandes' free-kick on 15 minutes.But after a lengthy VAR review, the goal was disallowed for Harry Maguire interfering with Rodriguez from an offside position.Three minutes later, United did deservedly lead when Pogba thundered in Luke Shaw's cross from the edge of the box.Moments later Burnley captain Ben Mee turned Marcus Rashford's cross into his own net, but was handed a reprieve by a harsh foul given against Pogba in the build-up.""We scored three goals,"" Rangnick said.""The second (disallowed goal) the linesman flagged foul but he flagged it 10 seconds after that incident.""This was a very soft decision.""Burnley had barely offered anything of note as an attacking force in the first half.Sean Dyche had named an offensive looking side with January signing Wout Weghorst supported by Rodriguez, Maxwel Cornet and Dwight McNeil.And the Burnley boss got his reward in a fast start to the second half.Weghorst left Maguire trailing and slipped in Rodriguez, who held off the United captain, to dink the ball beyond David De Gea.After being a spectator for 45 minutes, De Gea was then called into action again to prevent Weghorst completing the comeback with a powerful hit from outside the box.Rangnick turned to Ronaldo for a goal 23 minutes from time but it was Varane who came closest to a winner with an inventive backheel that Pope turned behind.Burnley's 11th draw in 20 league games this season is not enough to move them off the foot of the table and the gap between the Clarets and safety stretched to four points on Tuesday thanks to Newcastle's 3-1 win over Everton.",sports

To make things even peculiar, Bopara then got embroiled in a ball-tampering incident which saw Sylhet penalised five runs. The curious captaincy changes have seen the BPL garner focus for the wrong reasons. Naeem played eight matches, scoring at an average of 10.57 and a strike-rate of 117. He was brought in as captain but the reason had been just as peculiar as the changes.The team management had back then suggested that they were looking to play more aggressive cricket, which is why Naeem was brought in for Miraz. Chattrogram have won only three of their eight games so far and two of those wins came under Miraz's captaincy.",sports

When all hopes seemed to have faded for Sylhet, Alauddin Babu, in at number eight, struck three consecutive sixes to pacer Kamrul Islam Rabbi to bring down the equation to 18 off the last three balls but the right-arm seamer held his nerves and eventually Sylhet ended up on 167 for six while chasing to surpass Khulna's total of 182.
 
Babu remained unbeaten on 25 off just seven balls, striking three sixes and a four, with Mosaddek Hossain unbeaten after a 22-ball 39.
 
Wicket-keeper opener Anamul Haque struck 47 off 33 balls at the start to give his side the stable platform and Collin Ingram, at one-down, contributed with 37 off 28 balls but Sylhet was stifled by Soumya Sarkar and Thisara Perera post-Powerplay, after which the Sunrisers kept wickets at regular intervals.

After being sent in to bat first, Barishal posted 155 for five and in reply, Comilla were restricted to 123 for nine, courtesy of some tight bowling from Nayeem Hasan who picked up three wickets while Dwayne Bravo and Shakib scalped two wickets apiece.Shakib removed both Comilla openers Imrul Kayes (1) and the in-form Liton Das (19) after which the Victorians kept losing wickets at regular intervals despite Mominul Haque top-scoring with a run-a-ball 30. Young Mahmudul Hasan Joy, batting at number four, was dismissed on five while overseas players Moeen Ali and Sunil Narine were unable to make an impact with the bat as well in the absence of Faf du Plessis in the playing eleven. 
 
Earlier, it was young Munim who, playing just his second game of the tournament, showed his big-hitting capabilities to give his side the necessary momentum despite Barishal losing opener Chris Gayle (10) early. Najmul Hossain Shanto (1) also departed cheaply but Munim made sure Barishal had piled up 53 runs in the Powerplay.

Moeen first visited Bangladesh with England's age-level team in 2005. He also played the Dhaka Premier League in 2010-2011 with Mohammedan. Amidst visits with the national team, Moeen also had a stint in the BPL in 2013. However, he had never come to Sylhet before.On Sunday, following practice, the English all-rounder talked about his family visiting Sylhet.""My wife is here. Her sisters, brother in law, they are all in Dhaka, coming to Sylhet in two days' time,"" Moeen told reporters in Sylhet.Born in England to parents from Pakistan, Moeen feels just as much at home in Bangladesh. Although the bio-bubble meant that the lend-handed batter cannot roam around with family.""Bangladesh is home; Pakistan is home; England is home. I see them as all the same to be honest. All my in-laws are here. Respect to them, it's my first time Syhlet. They always used to tell me, 'let's go to Syhlet' but somehow, I couldn't manage the time. It's nice to be here now. It's a shame we can't go out but I am very happy to be here,"" he said.Moeen was, however, keen on learning more Sylheti words.""I know a few Sylheti words and that's about it. I wish I learned more actually. I would try and learn more now that I am here. Because the guys at the hotel are speaking Sylheti to me,"" the 34-year-old cricketer said.",sports
251,"Minister Group Dhaka's Afghan wicketkeeper batter Mohammad Shahzad was seen smoking an electronic cigarette in the middle of the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium (SBNCS) ahead of their Bangabandhu Bangladesh Premier League game against Comilla Victorians today.Dhaka are scheduled to play Comilla Victorians in the night game and the players of both sides were seen on the field assessing the conditions after the day game between Fortune Barishal and Sylhet Sunrisers had to be abandoned due to rain.Shahzad was seen smoking while having a conversation with another Afghanistan cricketer Karim Janat of Comilla Victorians. Later, Bangladesh's ODI skipper and Dhaka opener Tamim Iqbal along with head coach Mizanur Rahman were seen having a chat with Shahzad, probably asking him not to smoke on the field. ""To be honest, this is not acceptable as we all try to keep the game of cricket clean both on and off the field. Being an international cricketer, Shahzad should be aware of the etiquettes that he needs to follow during a game of cricket,"" BPL's technical committee convenor Raquibul Hasan told The Daily Star regarding the incident. Raquibul also mentioned that whether any action will be taken against Shahzad will be decided by the match referee. ""This falls under the jurisdiction of the match referee and it will be decided by him if Shahzad is to be reprimanded,"" added Raquibul. Neeyamur Rashid is the match referee for the game between Dhaka and Comilla. This is, however, not the only instance of notorious activity by Shahzad.

252,"There was joy and jubilation on one side, a clutter of youthful energy converging and coming through. At the side of things, wearing a dreary look was the experienced Tamim Iqbal, stranded at the other end in the last delivery after what should have been a match-winning knock of 73. Tamim would have hoped that Mohammad Naim would do something special, only his partner could not find what was required. The one who got it right was Chattogram Challengers' 20-year-old Mrittunjoy Chowdhury, holding his nerve against the odds in a crucial death over against experienced batters.There are quite a few oddities leading up to this three-run win against Dhaka. Mehedi Miraz's ejection from captaincy created a hail in the media which brought up bad memories of BPL scandals in the past. Then Naeem Islam was replaced by Afif Hossain yesterday with the former not even making the playing eleven against Dhaka.There was joy around Mrittunjoy; other young guns Afif, Nasum Ahmed, Shoriful Islam and Shamim Hossain converging towards him, a brilliant last moment of sheer joy of going against the odds. A young side, answering for themselves amidst the circus. Most of those names have done their bit in this ongoing BPL but things have remained clumsy for the franchise.""We're a young side. Our sense of joy in a win or disappointments in defeats is a bit more than others. We were very cheerful at the beginning [of BPL]. It was a matter of proving ourselves as youngsters. There was a lot of planning for today's game and when it was won, it was difficult to contain that joy,"" Mrittunjoy told The Daily Star in an interview yesterday.Tamim was set for glory, his side needing just nine runs in that last over. ""Nine runs [in an over] is too little to defend,"" the pacer remarked.There was a quiet confidence about him and he knew how to shift his plans. From picking up Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Qais Ahmed's wicket with slowers in previous spell, he went to his yorkers with five deliveries remaining. ""I planned according to the batters and then tried to execute. Panic doesn't do you good. I would have tried slowers if Tamim bhai was new to the crease, but at that moment I felt he might get under it and yorkers were the better option. The changes in pace was confusing them,"" he said, having landed one of his yorkers that sneaked under set-batter Tamim during the match.""I went very wide of the crease, I wanted to land it right [ a tad outside off stump] where his bat would come down from natural stance,"" he said when asked about cutting down Tamim's bat swing with yorkers.""I like the challenge of death over bowling. I feel less pressure than normal and competing with batters gives me confidence. I feel I have an idea of how batters think. When I have bad days, I feel I have enough experience of bad days struggling two years with injury.""He has 10 wickets in five games now, including a hattrick in one and a three-wicket over in another. A beacon for Chattogram in the dark. ""I wanted to do well this BPL for my family, my coaches, my support structure.""Biggest facet of this win is that it keeps their hopes alive. 'We're very energized now'.Meanwhile, in the night game that followed, Sylhet Sunrisers' hopes of progressing to the next round faded completely despite a 49-ball 90 from Colin Ingram as they fell short by 12 runs against Fortune Barishal, who amassed 199 while batting first, the second-highest total of this BPL edition, riding on quick-fire knocks from opener Munim Shahriar (51 off 28), Shakib Al Hasan (38 off 19) and Dwayne Bravo (34 off 13) while Chris Gayle (51 off 45) anchored the innings from the top.",sports
253,"Who would not love to captain his side? It is something that a lot of players dream of. We often hear players say, ""It's a dream come true to captain the side.""But we can't expect any such usual practice when it comes to the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).The ongoing BPL probably made headlines mostly for captaincy changes, especially for teams to replace skippers just before the start of a match. And more interestingly, most players have refused to take the role. Let's begin with the controversy surrounding Mehedi Hasan Miraz during the Chattogram leg of the competition.The Miraz drama, which was initiated after the player was stripped of captaincy just hours before their game against Sylhet Sunrisers, eventually ended after reaching an understanding with the franchise, but the player made it clear that he would not captain the side if asked again.Once again sudden captaincy changes took centre stage in the Sylhet leg of the tournament. After Sylhet Sunrisers surprised with a captaincy change on Monday, Chattogram Challengers yesterday had Afif Hossain replace Naeem Islam, who had in fact replaced Miraz as captain earlier.When Chattogram had Miraz stripped off captaincy, they did not cite any issue regarding the player's performance. However, in Naeem's case, the team mentioned that the player had to be dropped due to his poor performance. On Monday, after Sylhet replaced Mosaddek Hossain with Ravi Bopara as their captain, Sylhet team manager Kazi Al Mashuk Bari disclosed that players like Anamul Haque and Mohammad Mithun refused to take the responsibility.It is, however, not sure if Chattogram had asked anyone else to replace Naeem before approaching Afif. But one thing is certain that the captaincy circus has reached such a stage that no one can be sure as to who will be coming in to flip the coin in BPL anymore.",sports
254,"Bangladesh pacer Ebadot Hossain has been nominated as the ICC's player of the month for January. Courtesy of his maiden five-wicket haul in the first Test against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui, Bangladesh registered their maiden Test win over the World Test Champions by eight wickets earlier this year. Ebadot who picked just one wicket in the first innings delivered his career-best performance in the second innings, as the right-arm pacer ended up with the figures of 46 for 6 and was the man of the match.Apart from Ebadot South African batter Keegan Petersen and the young under-19 sensation Dewald Brewis was also among the three candidates for the men's player of the month. Nicknamed 'Baby AB' South Africa's Brewis left a mark in the recently concluded ICC Men's U19 Cricket World Cup. With a total of 506 runs in the tournament, he finished as the leading run-scorer of the tournament at an average of 84.33 and now holds the record for the most runs in a single edition of the ICC Men's U19 Cricket World Cup. He was also adjudged as the Player of the Tournament.  Right-handed batter Petersen steered South Africa to a stunning Test series win over India last month. Petersen scored a superb 82 as South Africa completed a seven-wicket victory in the third Test and a 2-1 series win over India. Petersen was the leading scorer in the series with 276 runs and was also adjudged the player of the Series. Previously Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan have won the ICC's player of the month for Bangladesh.

Athapaththu was also the leading run-scorer in the ICC Commonwealth Games Qualifier in Malaysia as Sri Lanka won all four of their matches. West Indian Dottin smashed her career best ODI score of 150 from just 158 balls set West Indies women up in the opening ODI against South Africa in Johannesburg.Heather Knight struck an unbeaten hundred in the Women's Ashes tour against Australia that helped England stay afloat on day two at the Manuka Oval in Canberra.",sports

Following on Chattogram Challengers' footsteps, Sylhet Sunrisers surprised with a captaincy change of their own, this time right before the toss of the evening match against Khulna Tigers with Ravi Bopara coming as captain at the toss.
The team sheet had named Mosaddek Hossain as captain but had Bopara's signature on it. Sylhet's team manager Kazi Al Mashuk Bari was contacted by The Daily Star and he informed that they had made a mistake in the team sheet which was signed by him along with Bopara. Mosaddek, apparently had asked to be relieved of captaincy a few days ago. ""Mosaddek talked to the coach after arriving at the field today and following discussion we talked to Bijoy and Mithun again, but they rejected the request to take over. Then we approached Bopara and he will be the captain from now,"" the manager told The Daily Star.
New captain Bopara would then get embroiled in controversy as he was caught on camera tampering with the ball with his fingernails. The on-field umpires immediately noticed and changed the ball while penalising Sylhet with five runs for the offence. There was no official confirmation of the incident from the BCB till filing of this report.

They played really well. They showed a lot of patience. They showed a bit of fight. It is a tough graft out there. It is just a good days' hard and tough Test cricket,"" Wagner said at a post-day virtual press conference. While Bangladesh are missing a number of senior players including Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal as well as the now-retired Mahmudullah Riyad, it was Mahmudul Hasan Joy (70*) and Najmul Hossain Shanto (64) who stepped up and took the charge to the opposition.

265,"Soccer jerseys are everywhere in football-mad Brazil, often with the numbers of the country's all-time legends: Ronaldo's 9, Pele's 10, Romario's 11. But one number is off-limits: 24, the focus of a homophobic taboo whose origin story is a wacky roller-coaster ride through more than a century of Brazilian history, winding up with the present -- but slowly shifting -- anti-gay attitudes that loom large in football today.The story of the 24 taboo goes back to 1892, when the founder of Brazil's first zoo, Baron Joao Batista Viana Drummond, came up with a creative way to fix its troubled finances: a lottery called ""o jogo do bicho"" (the animal game).Visitors to the Rio de Janeiro zoo received an animal figurine, and every day the baron's staff would randomly select one of the 25 animals, with a cash prize for everyone who had that figurine.The game soon exploded, as quick-thinking entrepreneurs printed bingo-like cards with the 25 animals and started selling shots at different jackpots.The game was banned three years later, but had already become a Brazilian institution -- and remains one today, run by a mafia with ties to some of the biggest businesses in Brazil: politics, carnival, music... and football.The 24th square on the game card is a deer, or ""veado"" -- a word used as a homophobic slur in Portuguese, apparently because deer are seen as feminine and sometimes engage in homosexual relations.And that is why male footballers in Brazil fear the number 24.""It's crazy when you think about it, because it's just a number like any other. But there's definitely a taboo,"" said Bernardo Gonzales, an LGBTI activist and player for trans men's futsal team Sport Club T Mosqueteiros in Sao Paulo.He said some Brazilian men even shun 24 when they pick a seat at the movies, rent an apartment or turn 24 -- saying they are 23+1.""Footballers would rather use another number, because they don't want anyone questioning their masculinity,"" he told AFP.- 'Not here' -In the Brazilian men's first division, just four of the 20 teams currently have number 24s. Three are young players on their first professional contracts.""I think it's important for every club to include (the number),"" said one, Kevin Malthus, a 19-year-old midfielder with Santos.""It's just a number that ended up with this homophobic prejudice around it. But some great athletes have used it, like Kobe Bryant,"" he told news site UOL.The biggest name in Brazilian football to wear the number is currently Victor Cantillo, a Colombian international midfielder who joined Sao Paulo club Corinthians in 2020.Cantillo caused a flutter when he arrived in Brazil by deciding to keep number 24, which he had worn at his previous club, Junior.""Not 24, not here,"" said Corinthians' then-director for football, Duilio Monteiro Alves.The comment triggered widespread backlash and a campaign that saw numerous players -- including one of Brazil's biggest stars, Flamengo striker Gabigol -- wear the number for a match.But the polemic rolls on.LGBTQ rights group Arco-Iris recently took Flamengo to court for excluding number 24 from its squad for an under-20 cup in Sao Paulo last month.Prosecutors said it would be difficult to prove a ""discriminatory motive,"" and the case was shelved.A player for another team in the tournament, America Mineiro winger Jurandir, wore number 24 -- and drew homophobic chants.- 'Symbol of resistance' -""Despite all the criticism and social movements, it hasn't been enough"" to eradicate the taboo, said sociologist Rodrigo Monteiro of Fluminense Federal University.""Football is still a very masculine space.""The controversy has largely spared the Brazilian national team, since most international tournaments allow just 23 players and require sequential numbers.But last year, when Covid-19 havoc led Copa America organizers to allow 28-player squads, Brazil were the only country not to register a number 24.Arco-Iris took that case to court, too, calling the move ""homophobic.""The Brazilian Football Confederation said the decision was based on ""sporting considerations,"" and the case was shelved.By contrast, number 24 is regularly used in Brazilian women's football, and hugely popular on LGBTQ teams.""It's a symbol of resistance,"" said Gonzales -- himself sporting number 24.",sports

Solomon King gave Sheikh Jamal a 20th-minute lead before Chinedu Mathew struck twice in 37th and 55th minutes respectively.Away at Munshiganj, Independence Cup and Federation Cup champions Abahani appeared a shell of their double-winning selves, squandering a plethora of chances, including a penalty, before sharing honours with a resilient Bangladesh Police.Bangladesh Police again gave a superior side a run for their money and found themselves on the verge of upsetting six-times champions Abahani, but could not keep out a stoppage-time equaliser eerily reminiscent to the stoppage-time goal they conceded in a 1-0 loss to Saif SC in their opening game.On the back of a narrow 1-0 win over Muktijoddha Sangsad in their previous match, Abahani looked a bit of nervous, misplacing passes and squandered some easy scoring chances. Bangladesh Police goalkeeper Mohammad Nehal made some brilliant saves while Abahani's Brazilian forward Dorielton Gomes wasted two easy chances, including a penalty.Abahani also saw a strike from Jewel Rana ruled out due to offside in the 73rd minute before their luck seemingly ran out and they conceded four minutes later from a counter.Tutul Hossain Badsha's poor attempt to clear Isanur Rahman's cross saw the ball fall to Brazilian forward Denilson Rodrigues, who made no mistake angling the ball to the far post.Bangladesh Police's attempt to kill time thereafter was far from subtle, prompting referee Symoon Hasan to add on eight minutes of stoppage time but Abahani needed only three to find the equaliser. Colindres whipped in a nice cross from the left for Dorielton, who glanced a header past Nehal and spare Abahani the blues.",sports

280,"From being a torchbearer at the world's top sporting event to competing in her first Winter Olympics race, cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang experienced two memorable moments in just 18 hours.Dinigeer, 20, and Zhao Jiawen, 21, a men's Nordic combined athlete, jointly lit the cauldron at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games on Friday.Born into a family of skiers, Dinigeer grew up in Altay prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, where a rock painting of people hunting on skis was discovered in 2005. Chinese experts estimated the painting was at least 10,000 years old, leading Altay to be widely recognized as the earliest known ""origin of skiing"".Unique geographical and climatic conditions in Altay have made skiing indispensable in local people's lives. The prefecture has also become the cradle of China's Alpine and cross-country skiing athletes since the 1980s.Dinigeer's father, Yilamujiang Muraj, placed third in a national cross-country skiing competition in 1993. He has been training young people in cross-country skiing since he retired from competition, coaching his daughter and discovering several other athletes.He is now a member of China's national cross-country ski coaching team.Yilamujiang said he has been excited and proud of his daughter since the opening ceremony.""I'm as happy as my daughter for her to have the opportunity to light the cauldron on the Olympic stage,"" he said.Zhao Weichang, China's first Winter Olympics flag bearer at the 1980 Games in Lake Placid, United States, and a string of other veterans handed the torch to Dinigeer and Zhao Jiawen, who were both born after 2000, embodying the spirit of passing on China's winter sports heritage, said Zhao Weidong, a spokesman for the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.""The arrangement illustrates that China has successors in the cause of winter sports, passing from generation to generation, and also shows that China is a firm pursuer of the Olympic ideal,"" he said.The number of Chinese athletes participating in the Winter Olympics has grown from 28 in 1980 to 176 this year.Dinigeer said she was very excited after she learned she could be a torch bearer.""I felt so proud at the opening ceremony of Beijing 2022,"" she said. ""The experience will be a long-lasting inspiration.""In 2010, Altay formed a 20-member youth cross-country ski team, coached by Yilamujiang. Dinigeer was one of three girls on the team.""She's got my athleticism,"" he said, adding that talent is one thing, but rigorous scientific training is essential.Yilamujiang and his daughter often discuss skiing skills, watch videos of cross-country skiing events and practice basic movements.In 2012, Dinigeer competed at the 12th National Winter Games in Northeast China's Jilin province. After the race, she told her father that she hoped to win a race one day and stand on the podium like a professional athlete. With her father's support, she went on to become a professional skier.China set up its first national cross-country skiing training team in 2018. Talent and hard work helped Dinigeer become a member of the team and she later achieved good results in several international events, helping her earn a place as a member of China's sports delegation for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.Dinigeer's race at the Winter Olympics — the 7.5 km + 7.5 km skiathlon — was held on Saturday in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province. In a field of 65 competitors from 24 countries, she finished in 43rd place.""It's my first ever appearance at the Winter Olympics,"" she said. ""I can learn a lot from competing with top athletes from all over the world. I believe such experiences can make me progress faster.""Dinigeer and her father greeted each other as soon as the competition was over.""We didn't talk much,"" she said. ""Instead, we caught each other's eye and hugged. We both understand the meaning of that hug.""Yilamujiang said, ""Completing the race is already a breakthrough.""He said the race was not all about winning, but also about the process and participation. An athlete cannot develop into a champion without going through intensive competition in big sports events, he said. Copyright: China daily/asian news network",sports

289,"Despite the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Bangladesh's economy pulled off a stunning 6.94 per cent growth in the last fiscal year, way higher than the initial estimate.The final figure is up 1.51 percentage points compared to the provisional estimate, thanks to the rebound of the industrial sector, especially the cottage, small, medium and large industries, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).The provisional estimate was 5.43 per cent. Planning Minister MA Mannan yesterday disclosed the final figures of the gross domestic product (GDP) after the meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council. Calling the growth ""a miracle"" amid the pandemic, the minister said, ""It's a miracle that our GDP growth surged to nearly 7 per cent while many other countries took a hit.""He said that the prime minister was very happy because of the achievement and she has dedicated this to the countrymen.The economic growth figure is much higher than the projections made by the international organisations.The World Bank (WB) had projected that Bangladesh would have a GDP growth of 5 per cent by the end of FY2021. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it would be 4.6 per cent and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) put the figure at 5.5 per cent. Mannan said that the WB, the ADB and the IMF naturally do their projection. ""But, this year, the World Bank has corrected its own projections. They have finally raised it. Our final growth is almost equal to the World Banks's projection."" ""I repeatedly say: it is our product that has been achieved by our people. We have full confidence in it. It's open to analysis,"" he said.    State Minister for Planning Prof Shamsul Alam said, ""We count this GDP system according to the United Nations' procedures and our national technical expert committee has overseen it.""""The IMF and the World Bank don't collect the data in the way we collect from the local level. They do it depending on some assumptions and international trade flows that are subjective. Lastly, they have used our data and updated them.""Prof Alam said the growth in national GDP was an indication that the economy had bolstered on the back of export and remittance.""Additionally, revenue collection improved last fiscal year, indicating that businesses recovered, allowing them to pay more value-added tax and tax.""Contacted, Prof Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the economic growth has been better as Bangladesh has been able to take the opportunity amid the pandemic instead of going into lockdown.""As a result, the economy was functional with the help of some stimulus packages. There was domestic demand and external factors were also in favour of Bangladesh.""According to the BBS, the industrial sectors boomed, the service sector slightly declined while agriculture fared well.In FY19-20, the industrial sector grew 3.61 per cent. It rose to 10.29 per cent in FY21.Large industries surged 10.61 per cent from the provisional estimate of 6.40 per cent.Micro, small and medium industries accelerated from 6.03 per cent to 13.89 per cent and the cottage industry expanded 10.27 from the provisional estimate of 1.6 per cent. The agriculture sector grew 3.17 per cent, up from 2.37 per cent a year ago.Under the transport sector, the growth of land and water segments declined in the final estimate. Air transport contracted 2 per cent as both domestic and international flights were suspended because of the pandemic-induced lockdowns. Gross national income per capita rose to $2,591 in FY21 from $2,540 a year ago, showed BBS data. The size of the GDP expanded to $416 billion, compared to $411 billion in the primary estimate. ",business
290,"Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it expects 2022 sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and antiviral pill to top $54 billion, but that fell short of lofty Wall Street estimates and its shares were off about three percent.Still, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said final sales for its oral Covid-19 antiviral, Paxlovid, could be ""way bigger"" than what Pfizer has forecast since its current outlook only included contracts that have been or are close to being signed.Pfizer currently expects $22 billion in 2022 sales of the treatment, compared with Wall Street estimates of $22.88 billion.""Clearly, this is only a fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture"" this year, Bourla told analysts on a conference call.The company is selling 20 million courses of Paxlovid to the United States at around $530 a course, but Bourla said that was a special price because of the size of the order.The price for most high income countries, he said, would be more or less in line with the price of Merck & Co's rival treatment molnupiravir, which the US government bought for around $700 a course.Pfizer executives said the company is in active discussions with over 100 countries about Paxlovid, and has the capacity to top 120 million courses if needed.For the Covid-19 vaccine Pfizer developed with Germany's BioNTech SE, the US drugmaker cautioned that final sales for the year may not top its current forecast of $32 billion, a 13 percent decline from 2021 levels.Last year, the company increased its Covid vaccine sales forecast several times as it signed more supply deals around the world.Analysts have forecast sales of $33.79 billion for the vaccine in 2022, according to Refinitiv data.Overall, Pfizer expects 2022 sales of $98 billion to $102 billion, also below estimates of $105.48 billion.""Looking forward is not as good as looking back for Pfizer now and that is why (the stock price) is down on a somewhat decent report,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC.Going forward, ""acquisitions are obviously very much in the cards,"" said Aamir Malik, Pfizer's chief business innovation Officer.Some investors have been looking for Pfizer to use its huge cash infusion from Covid products on deals to drive future growth.Pfizer said it had begun working on a next-generation version of Paxlovid, which is authorized to treat high-risk Covid-19 patients shortly after onset of symptoms.Paxlovid performed significantly better in its clinical trials than Merck's rival pill with about 90 percent efficacy versus 30 percent.But Pfizer may still need an improved version of Paxlovid, according to Davinderpreet Mangat, senior analyst at Informa Pharma Intelligence.""The door is slightly open, still, for Covid antivirals,"" Mangat said. ""Drugs from other companies may be able to surpass Paxlovid, similar to how Paxlovid surpassed Merck's drug.""",business
291,"There was no doubt that the growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in FY21 was better than the growth in FY20 even though the pandemic was present with all its ferocity in both years.When the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) came up with its preliminary estimate of 5.4 per cent growth based on data for the first 6-7 months of FY21, this seemed quite reasonable.But the second wave of Covid-19 struck Bangladesh in the second half of the year, forcing the government to impose a prolonged lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.The lockdown disrupted the entire economy except the production for export as factories were allowed to stay open. We, therefore, saw an improvement in export growth in the second half of FY21.Can this export turnaround explain the difference between the preliminary and final estimate of GDP growth?The answer is a clear negative because what matters in the growth calculation is the balance of exports and imports described as ""resource balance"" in the BBS's GDP estimate from the expenditure side.Import growth also increased significantly in the final estimate compared to the provisional. As a result, the excess of imports over exports is 56.3 per cent higher in the final estimate relative to the provisional.This means, other things equal, the final estimate of GDP growth should have been lower because of the larger negative resource balance in the final estimate relative to the provisional estimate.This leaves domestic demand as the other possible explanation. There are two components of domestic demand: consumption and investment.Household real consumption growth is 5 percentage points higher in the final estimate relative to the preliminary estimate.What happened in the second half of FY21, notwithstanding the lockdown, to boost consumption expenditure so much?Even official remittances, which boomed in FY21, cannot explain this because the total official remittances received in the second half was $11.83 billion compared to $12.94 billion in the first half.Real investment growth increased from 4 per cent in the preliminary estimate to 8.1 per cent in the final estimate.This is hard to reconcile with the 2.7 per cent nominal growth, implying negative real growth, in the government's Annual Development Program expenditures and the 8.4 per cent nominal growth, implying only 2.8 per cent real growth, in credit to the private sector in FY21.Note that the import of capital goods picked up significantly in nominal dollar terms in the second half of FY21, but this alone cannot account for the entire increase when juxtaposed with other related data.Therefore, it is overall hard to fathom where such a significant increase in the final estimate of GDP growth relative to the provisional came from. ",business
292,"The government is counting a loss of Tk 12.40 crore per day in selling diesel to customers as the price of the most-consumed fuel in Bangladesh is on the rise in the global markets.State-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), the lone importer, processor and supplier, loses Tk 8.72 while selling each litre of diesel.  The price of diesel has been going up in the global market for about a month now.Diesel was sold at $87.95 per barrel on freight on board basis on January 3 in the Arab Gulf market. It rose to $108.24 per barrel on February 7.Not only diesel fuel, but the price of all other petroleum products is also showing an upward trend. Many countries are stockpiling diesel because of the recovery in demand as the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are fading away, as well as the Russia-Ukraine tension, said analysts. If the current upward trend of the diesel price goes on, it may go up to $115 per barrel towards the end of February. This may widen losses for the BPC.Speaking to The Daily Star, BPC Chairman ABM Azad said: ""It is a matter of concern the way the oil price is going up in the international market. The BPC will be in trouble if the price goes up further.""In order to keep the supply smooth, the BPC is being compelled to import diesel at a higher price.Bangladesh consumed about 63 lakh tonnes of fuel oil last fiscal year. It may go up to 67.50 lakh tonnes in the current fiscal year as the economy is making a turnaround from the coronavirus pandemic. Of the fuel consumption, 46 lakh tonnes were diesel, 5.59 lakh tonnes furnace oil, 3.78 lakh tonnes petrol, 3 lakh tonnes octane, and 1 lakh tonnes kerosene, according to BPC officials.On average, 15,000 tonnes of diesel is sold in Bangladesh every day, up from 14,900 tonnes in February last year.The BPC is facing a loss anew.The government raised diesel price by Tk 15 per litre on November 4 when crude oil was selling at $85 per barrel in the international market, sources at the energy ministry said. The move was aimed at recovering the losses of the state-run agency from the surging global energy prices. Before the hike, the BPC was losing about Tk 20 crore per day.BPC was at break-even on January 11 when diesel was selling at $94 per barrel in the global market. It began incurring losses when the price shot up above $95.57 per barrel the following day. Globally, the oil price is rising due to strong demand, ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe and potential supply chain disruptions due to cold US weather conditions, said Reuters yesterday.Brent crude hit a seven-year high of $94 per barrel on Monday.According to Platts Asia Pacific/Arab Gulf Marketscan, the price of octane went up to $105.12 per barrel on February 7 from $90.04 on January 3.Jet fuel price shot up to $104.16 per barrel from $84.33 and furnace oil price rose to $524.01 per tonne from $445.62 during the period.Kazi Mohammad Mozammel Hoque, director for finance of the BPC, says as diesel accounts for 73 per cent of the fuel oil used in Bangladesh, the loss is high because of higher consumption. ",business

294,"The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has ordered the managing director and directors of Tamha Securities to sell its assets and deposit the proceeds at Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) by May 31.The BSEC passed the directive through a letter in a bid to ensure reimbursement of funds of general stock investors which were embezzled by the broker.Recently, a group of investors who fell victim urged the BSEC to take action immediately, citing that they were passing days in peril losing their hard-earned money.The BSEC said the premier bourse would reimburse the victim investors from the sale proceeds and the brokerage would have to update the regulator on the return on a weekly basis.Last December, the DSE suspended trading of the stock brokerage firm on receiving allegations of it embezzling investors' money.The BSEC has unearthed a deficit of Tk 87 crore in the consolidated customers' account.""For the sake of general investors, Tamha Securities' trading, business operations and activities as a depository participant have been halted,"" said the premier bourse in a circular.However, investors are allowed to transfer shares by opening a linked account with any other stock brokerage firm.Mizanur Rahman, a stock investor, said it was a good step to hasten the reimbursement process.Alongside, it should be handed down exemplary punishment, he said.The stock investor urged the regulator to fast check other stock brokers' issues to see whether they had siphoned off peoples' funds.Many investors lost money in the last 12 years from the closure of at least five brokerage houses, which sold off investors' shares and refrained from carrying out purchase orders even after accepting funds.Embezzlement of funds has intensified in recent years.Three brokerage houses – Banco Securities, Crest Securities and Tamha Securities—were shut in the last two years for allegedly embezzling around Tk 200 crore of general investors.In the middle of 2021, the trading activities of Banco Securities were suspended following an allegation of siphoning off Tk 66 crore.The DSE suspended the trading of Crest Securities in 2020 for embezzling Tk 48 crore.",business
295,"Over the last two decades, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic progress, epitomised by the fact that the country's GDP, according to the World Bank, grew more than six-fold in real terms from $53.37 billion in 2000 to $324.24 billion in 2020.This has been supported by a structural transformation in trade and financial markets, harnessing the combined effects of capital deepening and cross-sectoral labour reallocation.From an economic perspective, Bangladesh's transformation thus far has been underpinned by two key elements: (1) trade concentration: the preponderance of textiles and clothing as a share of exports, and (2) persistent trade and current account deficits since 2016, supported by volatile remittances and unrequited transfers entailing offsetting capital account surpluses, foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign exchange reserves, and net external debt.In the last few years, FDI inflow into Bangladesh has been modest. Net FDI inflow into the country during 2018-2020 was $8.91 billion. During this period, Pakistan recorded a net FDI inflow of $9.17 billion, and India $154.51 billion.I believe that Bangladesh has the capacity to attract $25-30 billion in FDI annually with enhancements in its business climate indicators and continued reform in its regulatory environment. As such, DelMorgan plans to channel about $13 billion into key growth sectors in Bangladesh during 2022-23, including RMG, pharmaceuticals, financial services, infrastructure, real estate, and diversified manufacturing.I was pleased to meet Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), as we discussed the growth potential of the country, going forward. According to BGMEA, Bangladesh has 3,500 active clothing factories, 827 textile mills, and 433 spinning mills. It has 40 out of the world's top 100 garments factories.However, the challenges of the prevailing specialisation pattern are corroborated by the analysis of trade in value-added and related indicators of participation in global value chains.According to a recent report by the UNCTAD, Bangladesh's vulnerability profile highlights that, although the country is approaching LDC graduation on the back of sustained progress and with strong political will, there is no time for complacency.The UNCTAD Productive Capacities Index (PCI) shows that while Bangladesh has delivered steady improvements in the index during 2000-2018, it has consistently underperformed the LDC average productivity growth. In particular, out of the eight elements of the PCI, Bangladesh underperformed in seven components: ICT, transport, energy, institutions, private sector, structural change, and human capital.The only component in which it was at par with the LDC average was natural capital.Furthermore, the UNCTAD highlights four lingering sources of vulnerability which will continue to shape the trajectory of Bangladesh towards LDC graduation and beyond: (1) Heightened reliance on LDC-specific international support measures (most notably in terms of preferential market-access); (2) Lack of export diversification and over-reliance on low-technology textile and clothing products; (3) Dependence on external development finance, predominantly in the form of migrant remittances, to support capital accumulation; and (4) Exposure to the far-reaching effects of climate change.Bangladesh plans a GDP growth of 7.2 per cent in 2022, which should come out at the high end of what other developing countries are projecting. As expected, developing countries will outpace the global average GDP growth rates, but inflation and exchange rate management challenges remain.Based on the UN Global Policy Model, UNCTAD's Trade and Development report calculates overall global nominal GDP growth for 2022 at 3.6 per cent, driven by developing countries delivering 4.7 per cent nominal growth.Compounded by rising commodity prices and ensuing inflation pressures, real income growth has been negative in much of the eurozone. According to UNCTAD's Global Investment Trend Monitor, global FDI rebounded strongly in 2021, but recovery was highly uneven across regions and sectors. Infrastructure finance increased due to stimulus and greenfield projects in industry were still weak.Global FDI flows showed a strong rebound in 2021, up 77 per cent to an estimated $1.65 trillion, from $929 billion in 2020, surpassing their pre-Covid-19 level. Developed economies saw the biggest rise by far, with FDI reaching an estimated $777 billion in 2021 – three times the exceptionally low level in 2020.According to the UNCTAD, FDI flows to developing economies increased by 30 per cent to nearly $870 billion, with a growth acceleration in East and South-East Asia (20 per cent), a recovery to near pre-pandemic levels in Latin America and the Caribbean, and an uptick in West Asia.Net portfolio flows to developing countries are largely driven by non-resident investment in debt and equity. Of the total increase in global FDI flows in 2021 ($718 billion), more than $500 billion, or almost three quarters, was recorded in developed economies.On the economic front, the dramatic collapse of output, as countries locked down to contain the spread of the virus, was so dramatic as to trigger unprecedented responses. Massive central bank action in rich countries stabilised financial markets and aggressive government spending cushioned firms and households against the worst of the downturn.The liquidity risk associated with an expansionary fiscal policy is higher. For Bangladesh, progressive stages of economic development are associated with typical liquidity risk configurations. Non-investment grade countries such as Bangladesh have trouble accessing international credit markets, while exports and remittances are often the only sources of foreign currency.With impending LDC graduation, Bangladesh can expect declines in international commitments related to official development assistance. The recent decision of the government of Bangladesh to utilise $313 million from its foreign currency reserves for the purpose of investing in capital projects is likely to emasculate the foreign investor community's confidence in its monetary policy discipline and might serve as a precursor to a sovereign rating downgrade.The reality is that Bangladesh is highly dependent on global finance to support its balance of payments. The regime change in its interest rate environment resulting in a downward shift in its yield curve positioning is likely to further constrain both short and long-term debt inflows.While speculative capital inflows can overwhelm the domestic financial and credit markets, sustained above-average risk-adjusted returns can ensure sustained portfolio flows into the capital markets. From this point of view, it is market discipline, or being exposed to liquidity risk, that will prevent the country's policy-makers from spending their way to a structurally supportable path of debt sustainability.If mitigating liquidity risks is a national policy target, addressed, for example, by price and capital controls, it is mainly coordination between fiscal and monetary policies that will provide the needed policy space for the government of Bangladesh to ensure sustainable growth and development.While the independence of Bangladesh Bank is clearly inhibited by the mere existence of the banking division within the finance ministry, achieving the required degrees of policy coordination around a pro-development revamp of the national financial architecture is not trivial.The expansion of Bangladesh's external balance sheet can gain momentum with the participation of direct investors (i.e., FDI) and asset managers from advanced economies, in addition to targeting foreign currency-denominated corporate bond markets, increasing their participation in the country's domestic bond markets.While government bonds dominate Bangladesh's fairly underdeveloped secondary bond market, greater reliance on domestic-currency denominated public debt mitigates the currency mismatch in its balance sheet and creates duration mismatches arising from the prohibitive costs of issuing long-term government securities and weak governance of asset-liability immunisation risk. With limited access to non-deliverable forwards or active swap markets, it also shifts the currency risk to prospective global lenders, thus heightening exposure to speculative, non-resident investor behaviour.As a result of these vulnerabilities, strongly net negative, if fluctuating, portfolio flows to Bangladesh can translate into a vicious cycle of currency depreciation, weakening debt sustainability, and reduced fiscal spaces.Long-term FDI is thus a lower risk approach in support of Bangladesh's structural transformation, triggering reductions in sovereign credit spreads and driving up the value of foreign currency-denominated debt, thus also affecting private borrowers' balance sheets and refinancing risks.The author is a global managing director at DelMorgan & Co.

302,"Kabir Chowdhury, who hails from Dotto Pungoli village in Pabna's Faridpur upazila, became unemployed about 10 years ago after suffering huge losses in his cattle feed business.However, he has since found a new lease on life through cage fish farming, which is a type of aquaculture where fish are grown in floating net pens made of wood, bamboo or metal in natural water bodies.Chowdhury and his friend Md Abdur Razzak Nayan spent about Tk 20,000 to begin cage fish farming in the Boral river near their residence a few years ago. Now, the pair earn about Tk 8-9 lakh annually.""I came to know about cage fish farming through the internet,"" he said.Having piqued his interest, Chowdhury went to Chandpur to get more on-hand knowledge about this form of aquaculture.He eventually began farming fish in the Boral river with 10 pens made of bamboo in 2013. That year, Chowdhury and Nayan sold fishes worth about Tk 35,000 to get a profit of Tk 15,000.""This inspired us to forge ahead,"" he said.They kept expanding cultivation each year and now, the pair have a total of 65 cages in the river.""Last year, we sold fish worth Tk 80 lakh to earn Tk 8 lakh profit and this year, we expect to sell fish worth Tk 85 lakh to earn a profit of Tk 9-10 lakh,"" Chowdhury said, adding that his success encouraged many unemployed locals to start cage fish farming.Nayan told The Daily Star it costs about Tk 10,000 to set up a pen measuring 20 feet long and 10 feet wide made of iron rods and traditional nets.Each cage produces about 40 maunds (one maund equals about 37 kilogrammes) of fish thrice a year.""We cultivate 900 to 1,000 fish fry in each pen to get yields of 12 to 14 maunds,"" Nayan said.As the fish get proper nourishment in the flowing river, they grow rapidly and are comparatively tastier than their artificially grown counterparts, according to Robindranath Haldar, another cage fish farmer.Haldar, who hails from a village in the Narayanpur area of Faridpur upazila, set up 30 cages in the Boral river this year and expects to make a profit of Tk 4-5 lakh.Md Abul Kalam Azad, the district fishery officer, said cage fish farming has been gaining popularity over the past eight to 10 years thanks to its high returns.As such, various fishermen in Pabna's Faridpur, Sujanagar and Ishwardi upazilas have set up cage fish farms along the Boral and Padma rivers.There are now more than 500 cages in both rivers with a majority being in the Boral river.

""It is encouraging to see our targeted investments yielding such good performances throughout the year,"" he said.Market leader Grameenphone's total mobile phone customers jumped 5.56 per cent to 8.34 crore in December from 7.90 crore in December 2020.However, the operator lost over 5 lakh customers in December compared to November. According to Md Hasan, head of external communications of Grameenphone, the operator converted all its towers into 4G in 2021 in order to ensure a better customer experience, resulting in continuous customer growth.""In addition, the company is continuously investing in modernising its network through rolling out of new towers, deploying additional spectrum to 10,000 plus sites and improving its service quality significantly,"" he said.For state-owned Teletalk, which lags behind all the private operators by a big margin, 2021 was a year to celebrate as it added about 17 lakh customers in the past 12 months.It grew by 35 per cent to reach about 67 lakh customers year-on-year in December. While other private operators lost customers in December compared to November, Teletalk added over 1 lakh customers.Telecommunications Minister Mustafa Jabbar attributed the growth to Teletalk's network expansion and infrastructural development.""We have taken our network to many remote areas and invested heavily on infrastructure development, which paid off well,"" he said.About the operator's weak market position compared to other private operators, he said Teletalk's investment was meagre compared to Grameenphone or Robi.""So, now we want to invest more and take the service to remote areas where other operators do not provide services,"" he said. ",business
304,"The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has suggested local entrepreneurs focus on capacity building to become more competitive rather than seeking government support over the coming years.""Bangladesh is going to graduate from a least-developed country within the next four years and so, there will be no scope for the government to provide support to protect local industries,"" said NBR Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem.He was addressing a pre-budget discussion with the leaders of the Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicles Importers and Dealers Association (Barvida) and the Bangladesh Ceramic Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BCMEA) at the NBR conference room yesterday.Muneem went on to say that Bangladesh will face numerous challenges in conducting trade and business after the country's graduation in 2026.""For this reason, entrepreneurs will have to leave their support seeking mindset,"" he said.However, the NBR chairman assured that the government would still consider any industry's demand for support based on the merit of proposals.As such, the Barvida yesterday placed a demand before the NBR, asking for a new price depreciation scale for importing reconditioned cars as it would boost the market as well as government revenue.The NBR provides 10 per cent depreciation facilities for a one-year-old reconditioned car, 20 per cent for two-year-old cars, 30 per cent for three-year-old cars, and 35 per cent for those aged four years and above.The Barvida proposed to set the depreciation facility at 15 per cent for one-year-old cars, 25 per cent for two-year-old cars, 35 per cent for three-year-old cars, and 45 per cent for those aged four years and above.The NBR considers the depreciation benefit as per the yellow book, or new price, of the car.For example, the NBR currently slashes a vehicle's total price by 35 per cent if it underwent reconditioning four years before its import to Bangladesh.""We also urge the NBR to further reduce the customs duty on microbuses which are considered as mass transport as it would reduce the movement of non-compliant vehicles and save human lives,"" said Abdul Haque, a former president of the Barvida.Meanwhile, the BCMEA asked for the withdrawal of supplementary duties on tiles and sanitary ceramic products in order to protect the local industry.Manufacturers currently pay 15 per cent supplementary duty on tiles and 10 per cent on sanitary items.BCMEA President Md Shirajul Islam Mollah demanded the import duty imposed on China clay, the industry's main raw material, be reduced from the existing 30 per cent.He further demanded the NBR impose an additional 10 to 12 per cent import duty on the import of finished ceramic products in order to protect the local industry and build its capacity.Md Masud Sadiq, member (customs policy) of the NBR; Zakia Sultana, member (VAT policy); and Md Shamsuddin Ahmed, member (tax), also addressed the programme. ",business

311,"Unnerved by the sabre-rattling between Russia and the West over Ukraine, traders are scouring global markets for investments that could provide them with protection against losses in case the conflict escalates.Any conflict risks triggering a rout in riskier investments such as global stocks and a rush into so-called safe havens such as government bonds, gold and currencies like the US dollar and yen, leaving those exposed to equities with large losses.Typically, investors hedge against potential losses by buying assets that would pay out if the situation reverses, such as derivatives that could profit from a fall in stocks or commodities.But with markets already gyrating in the face of rising inflation, worries about global growth and tighter monetary policy, the cost of that protection has gone up sharply in recent days, according to five traders. Europe's equivalent of Wall Street's fear gauge -- an index which calculates how volatile investors expect stocks to behave in the short term -- is currently trading more than 50 per cent above its 2021 average, indicating how increased demand is pushing hedging costs up.Investors are having to peer deeper and farther across markets for ideas that offer affordable protection.In interviews, traders and investors said they are looking at a range of strategies, from derivative bets on how wildly French stocks will gyrate or how much German stocks will fall to simply looking for assets that are currently out of favour but would benefit if markets got worse.Two traders at major global banks, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said they are recommending their clients look at the French stock market and place derivative bets on volatility, a measure of the intensity of market swings.Their expectation is that volatility in French stocks will increase in the event of a conflict because it is one of the most liquid markets in Europe.One of the traders, who heads derivatives strategies at a top bank in London, is recommending that his clients buy call options on French stock market volatility, which would allow them to buy the underlying financial asset at a fixed price even as it rises in the event of a conflict.To defray some of the cost of such a bet, the trader is telling clients to sell options on US stock market volatility, which he thinks is likely to be less impacted by any escalation of the conflict. Taking such a two-pronged bet would, however, also reduce some of the profits should a conflict ensue.Swiss bank UBS is recommending buying call options on the yen or the US dollar, according to a note published this week. The two currencies would likely strengthen as investors seek out safe havens in the case of a conflict, making the bets profitable.Another suggestion from UBS is to buy put options on German stock benchmarks, a bet that will pay out if the market falls. That is a possibility because of the reliance of German companies on Russian energy for production.",business

317,"Japan's Toshiba on Monday announced plans to split into two companies, revising a controversial proposal to divide into three following a tumultuous period for the storied industrial conglomerate.The group said it plans to spin off its device segment, including its semiconductor business, in a bid to speed up decision-making and boost stock performance.Shareholders, who have clashed with management on the best way forward for the troubled company, must still approve the proposal in a vote expected in March.The original spin-off plan faced stiff opposition from some key investors.The firm also said it will unload its stake in air-conditioning business Toshiba Carrier and seek to sell its elevator and lighting units.""We believe a spin-off is optimal,"" president and CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa told investors, promising it would  ""enable more agile and flexible operations.""He said the sprawling business  ""struggled with the conglomerate discount and slowness in decision-making"" in the past, and streamlining operations would allow investors to choose the portion of the business that interested them.Toshiba initially unveiled a plan to split into three last November, in what analysts called a test case for other Japanese giants.But it said Monday that  ""since this is the first large-scale spin-off transaction in Japan... it turned out there were obstacles which were not initially expected"".Among those were higher-than-expected costs, and an extensive process to list the two new entities.A two-way split instead  ""can significantly reduce separation costs, secure financial soundness for each company, and significantly reduce spin-off uncertainty"", the company said.The spin-off is expected to cost 20 billion yen ($173 million) over two years, with running costs also increasing by 13 billion yen a year.But Tsunakawa said that would be offset by plans to reduce operating costs by 30 billion yen annually.The Japanese giant wants the split finalised by the second half of the 2022-23 financial year, but it could yet face shareholder opposition.General Electric and Johnson & Johnson have announced spin-offs in recent months -- a move analysts say is in large part forced on them by financial markets.Spin-offs can be a way for large corporations to create more value and rationalise operations, but they can also limit coordination between sectors, experts say.Toshiba dates back to 1875 and was once a symbol of Japan's advanced technological and economic power, but it has been mired in turmoil for several years.Last year, shareholders voted to oust the board's chairman after a series of scandals and losses, in a rare victory for activist investors in corporate Japan.As part of the overhaul, the company on Monday declared Toshiba Tec and its air-conditioning, elevator and lighting units  ""non-core businesses"".It has already agreed to the sale of Toshiba Carrier to the US-based Carrier Corporation in a deal reportedly worth some 100 billion yen.The conglomerate currently owns 60 per cent of the air-con company's shares and will retain only five per cent when the sale is completed later this year.It said it hoped to reach deals to offload the elevator and lighting units within the next two months.",business

As all hope slowly started to dwindle, the recognition brought forth gratitude from the cultural arena in the country.Nazrul Islam Babu was born in July 17, 1949 in Jamalpur. His father, Bazlul Kader, was a school-teacher and a music lover, by whom Babu was greatly inspired by.In 1971, a 21-year-old Nazrul Islam Babu took up arms for the country.

As soon as the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war ended, we went to Bangladesh and we did several events with (Bollywood actor) Sunil Dutt's group. At the time, we used to commute all around by Army plane.""Lata was part of an Indian cultural delegation which called on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family in Dhaka. Others in the delegation were actress Wahida Rehman, a young Sanjay Dutt and his father-actor Sunil Dutt.Following her demise yesterday, West Bengal's music fraternity paid rich tributes to the legendary singer who collaborated with some top music directors like Sachin Deb Burman, Hemanta Mukherjee and Salil Chowdhury to produce memorable hits in Bangla.Mangeshkar, who had sung some 185 songs in Bengali, is remembered by her fans here for classics such as 'Akash Prodip Jwole' (The light burns in the sky) and 'Prem Ekbar Esechhilo Nirobe' (love came once silently).Salil Chowdhury collaborated with Lata for some 35 Bengali songs, 20 of them for movies. Among their many hits in Bengali were modern numbers like `Ja re ure ja re pakhi' and Ami Cholte, Cholte Theme Gechi'.Musicians in Kolkata said while Lata understood Bengali as she had many friends among Bangla music directors and singers, at times she had to be explained the finer nuances of Bangla lyrics. But she picked up and rendered the nuances in a manner which only a great singer like her could have ever done.Popular singer Haimanti Shukla said Lata Mangeshkar did not have any arrogance and she often fretted over audience response before shows.",entertainment
337,"Lata Mangeshkar's voice is immortal.Yet if there is one song of hers that perfectly captures tributes to one of India's most beloved and revered singers, who passed away in a Mumbai hospital yesterday after a near month-long battle with post-Covid complications, it is ""Naam gum jayega"" from the 1977 movie ""Kinara"".The song has the lyric ""Naam gum jayega, chehara ye badal jayega/ Meri awaaz hi pehchan hai, agar yaad rahe"" (My name will be lost, my face will change/ My voice is my identity, only if you can remember).It is impossible to forget one of India's greatest cultural icons, whose songs spoke to the emotions of millions in South Asia, regardless of age or background.This became clearer than ever as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led thousands of mourners, many of them in tears, at Mumbai's landmark Shivaji Park where Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar was cremated with full state honours. Representatives of the army, air force and navy joined others from various walks of life, including cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan among the celebrities, in bidding farewell to her.At 92, Lata breathed her last in Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital where she was undergoing treatment since January 8 after being diagnosed with Covid and exhibiting mild symptoms. She was also diagnosed with pneumonia.""Lata di died at 8:12am due to multi organ failure after over 28 days since her Covid-19 diagnosis,"" Dr Pratit Samdani, who was treating the singer at the hospital, told reporters.The Indian government declared a two-day national mourning during which the national flag would fly at half-mast. The Maharashtra government announced a public holiday in the state and the West Bengal government half a day's holiday today as a mark of respect for Lata.Lata Mangeshkar had a prodigious career spanning almost eight decades during which she sang an estimated 25,000 songs in 36 Indian languages, including Hindi, Bangla, Marathi, Tamil and Kannada, of classical and other genres.Soon after news of Lata's death broke, tributes poured in with President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Modi leading a heartbroken nation in remembering her.""Lata-ji's demise is heart-breaking for me, as it is for millions the world over. In her vast range of songs, rendering the essence and beauty of India, generations found expression of their inner-most emotions. A Bharat Ratna, Lata-ji's accomplishments will remain incomparable,"" Kovind said.Modi said he was ""anguished beyond words"".""The kind and caring Lata Didi has left us.

The coming generations will remember her as a stalwart of Indian culture, whose melodious voice had an unparalleled ability to mesmerise people,"" he said in a tweet.""Lata Didi's songs brought out a variety of emotions. She closely witnessed the transitions of the Indian film world for decades. Beyond films, she was always passionate about India's growth. She always wanted to see a strong and developed India,"" he added.Lata Mangeshkar's cross-border appeal was evident when Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Pakistan's Information and Broadcasting Minister Fawad Hussain paid rich tributes.Considered one of the greatest playback singers in Indian cinema, Lata received several film awards and Indian government's top civilian honours like Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Bharat Ratna (2001), and Dada Saheb Phalke Award, Indian cinema's highest award, and multiple national film awards.During her career, she had earned many sobriquets -- Queen of Melody, Nightingale of India and simply The Legend. Many, including some the biggest music directors and actors, equated her voice with that of Goddess Saraswati.Among some of her most popular numbers are ""Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon"", which brought tears to the eyes of the then Indian PM Jawaharlal Nehru in 1963.Born in Indore, Lata Mangeshkar was the eldest child of Deenanath Mangeshkar, a Marathi musician and Gujarati homemaker Shevanti.The untimely death of her father brought the financial burden of the family on her teenaged shoulders. Family friend Master Vinayak came to the aid of the family and Lata started singing and acting in his father's theatre company.Since music was the be-all and end-all of Lata Mangeshkar's life, it would be apt to wrap up a tribute by recalling the 1966 Hindi film ""Mamta"" song ""Rahen na rahen hum"", the lyrics of which loosely translate to ""Whether or not I am here, I will remain as a fragrance in this garden"". Lata's voice will continue to live long after her death. ",entertainment

With the presence of Aly Zaker, Shubhash Dutta, Dr Enamul Haque and Nazmul Hossain, we were able to create our own theatre troupe,"" said the noted playwright.The name of Aranyak Natyadal was given by noted playwright and filmmaker Abdullah al Mamun.Besides staging shows in the country, Aranyak Natyadal has staged many plays overseas as well. Their first show, ""Kobor"", written by martyr Munir Chowdhury, was featured on February 20 in the year of their establishment.",entertainment

344,"Billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel will leave Facebook parent Meta's board, the firm said Monday, after a lengthy tenure that saw the network's rise and his vocal support of Donald Trump.Meta and Thiel's announcement offered nothing on his future plans, but the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported that he would focus on aiding Republican candidates backing ex-president Donald Trump's agenda in the midterm elections.""He has served on our board for almost two decades, and we've always known that at some point he would devote his time to other interests,"" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.Thiel is expected to leave the board after Meta's shareholder meeting, which is typically in May.He was Facebook's first outside investor, with a stake that made him hundreds of millions of dollars, joining the nascent giant's board in 2005.Thiel built his wealth through the online payments company PayPal, founded in 1998, and invested in Airbnb, Affirm, Stripe and SpaceX, among others.Considered one of the tech industry's most prominent conservatives, he became a supporter of Trump, including a $1.25 million donation in 2016 to the former reality TV star's campaign.""Mark Zuckerberg's intelligence, energy, and conscientiousness are tremendous. His talents will serve Meta well as he leads the company into a new era,"" Thiel said in the announcement.Thiel was a long-time confidant of Zuckerberg, but distanced himself from Silicon Valley culture over the years.""Our company was founded in Silicon Valley. But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector's values and commitments,"" said a prospectus for Palantir, a data analysis firm Thiel co-founded.""From the start, we have repeatedly turned down opportunities to sell, collect or mine data.""The news about Thiel's departure comes as Meta aims to move past its status as a scandal-plagued social media giant, to its metaverse vision for the future of the internet.However, that idea remains a distant goal and in the meantime the company faces regulators' scrutiny, troubles with its core ad business and a stock price that plunged on disappointing quarterly results.",tech_news
345,"Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel have said that the future of social media looks a lot more like TikTok in a seemingly rapid transition in the sector's market dynamics, The Verge reported.Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta -- Facebook's parent company -- identified TikTok as a formidable competition to the platform.""People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time, and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly,"" he said during Meta's fourth-quarter earnings call last Wednesday.Snapchat invented the stories format of sharing pictures and videos that disappear. Now the company is indicating, along with Facebook, that the future of social media looks more like TikTok.Later on Thursday, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap Inc. which introduced Snapchat, told investors for its quarterly earnings report that users are spending less time watching stories from friends in the app and instead opting to watch viral videos by random users on TikTok, according to the report.Users are increasingly enthusiastic to try out Snapchat's Spotlight section for trending videos and Discover section for premium shows, he said.""This is a continuation of the trend we have observed throughout the pandemic, and friends' story posting and viewing per daily active user have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,"" Spiegel told investors.""While we are hopeful our community will in time return to the friends' story behaviours that we observed prior to the pandemic, we are focused on innovating on our content offerings to better serve our community today.""Snap is yet to reveal exactly what changes it is bringing to its content section. However, it is likely that the tab will look more like TikTok with full screen videos of premium shows from Spotlight creators, The Verge reported.While Snap is still growing its user base and showing better-than-expected revenue growth, Meta has disappointed investors with more than $200 billion of its market value wiped out in a day.Both Facebook and Snap now not only see TikTok as competition, but also are playing to catch up with the trend that now delves into compelling new formats with the potential to shift user attention quickly, the report added.",tech_news
346,"In a casual conversation, team Oriental Phoenix, winners of this year's Arena of Valor Bangladesh Championship 2021, shares with us the behind-the-scenes journey and future aspirations. Here are key snippets from the conversation.Toggle: Please share the names of your team members, as well as your player names.Oriental Phoenix: Our team name is Oriental Phoenix. We are Ashadullah Al Galib a.k.a. Sugarkid, the Team Manager; Abdullah Al Mashud a.k.a. Deathly, the Team Leader; Fahraz Zamin Sparsha a.k.a. Beast; Nafees Ahmed a.k.a. MrCharming; Abrar Shahriar Subat a.k.a. Worthless; Fardin Hasan a.k.a. Pika Pika and Sheikh Matiur Rahman a.k.a. Sycen.T: Tell us about your journey. How did you get into gaming? What made you interested in playing mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games?OP: This journey wasn't easy for us. We have been playing MOBA games for the last 4 years. But with the same roster, we are playing for 2 years. We play MOBA games because it is our passion. We used to play different MOBA games like League of Legends, wild rift, and many more. We feel comfortable playing 5v5 MOBA games like Arena of Valor. It is sometimes too difficult to continue to play MOBA games but as competitive players, we are always hungry for big tournaments. In the past, we didn't play in any tournaments like this one before. Bigger opportunities and tournaments in other countries always inspired us to continue. We are hopeful that one day we will play at an international level.T: Were there any challenges in your personal life that got in the way of you participating in tournaments like this or starting a career in gaming?OP: Yes, we had to face a lot of difficulties but Alhamdulillah, we had passed it. Sycen had some physical difficulties but still, the power and the love for the game made him stronger and he joined the tournament. The sacrifices that we made through our journey in this tournament allowed us to come out with a championship. We did it even without having a sponsor or coach for our team. As we have mentioned, we didn't play that many tournaments and LAN events like this before in our competitive career, so we had lost motivation many times. But the ultimate bonding power that our team has with each other, made us become the champions of Bangladesh.T: How do you think esports changed your career?OP: We play MOBA games because it is our passion. However, right now we can't dedicate ourselves to it and focus on it as our careers, as we don't have that many opportunities yet. We'd rather say, this esports journey gave me a family and empowered me to pursue my passion. But now we can proudly say that we are esports players and we are going to represent Bangladesh globally.T: What encourages you to continue playing MOBA games and Arena of Valor? OP: We never feel bored when we play together. We can spend our time in our own way and it helps with our overall mental health. MOBA games need many strategies, tactics, perfect planning etc. We make our own plans by ourselves. When we see a MOBA game like Arena of Valor giving opportunities to players like us so that we can start our own gaming careers, it gives us inspiration.T: How does it feel to be the winner of the biggest esports tournament in Bangladesh to date?OP: Our team is really happy because all of our hard work paid off. The Arena of Valor Bangladesh Championship was the first and biggest official LAN tournament in our country. It was a great experience and after being announced the champions of the tournament, all of our members are feeling really happy.T: What were the team's biggest strengths in the tournament?OP: Our greatest strengths in the tournament were; respecting our team leader's words, our maturity and our ultimate team bonding.T: There were many big names and old teams like Yorozuya, WE Esports, MARTYRS etc. How did it feel to deal with such teams?OP: We all were a bit nervous as the games could have gone to either of the teams. Defeating Yorozuya was probably our best moment; they played like champions themselves. Nonetheless, we kept our calm in every game and made fewer mistakes which led to us winning against big names such as Yorozuya, WE Esports and MARTYRS. We respect the top 8 teams in Bangladesh and they are our equals.T: Tell us a bit of history about you and your teammates. How did you set up your team? Where did you meet?OP: It's a big story. We have changed our roster many times before. But for the last 2 years, we have been playing together with the same team. There were many ups and downs but those times made us stronger.T: How did it feel to start the first match of the Grand Finale against Yorozuya, arguably the most dominating team in Bangladesh?OP: Playing against Yorozuya was totally new for us. We had to face them to start the final journey. There were two sides to this. First, we knew that if we win our matches, we are not going to go back home without the trophy. But if we lose, we will lose our mental strength a little bit. But perfect calculation and proper strategic gameplay made it possible. Yorozuya dominated the whole game but in the end, they made a mistake and we took advantage of that opening and we won the match.T: WE Esports Armada defeated your team during the Chittagong City Qualifiers Final, this time, you defeated them 2-0. What changed and how did it feel?
Answer: We always believe that a comeback is stronger. We have to admit, that due to some game issues and bugs we couldn't give our 100% in the Chittagong LAN final. That was unexpected, but we took it positively. We also don't lose to the same opponent twice!T: Walk us through the final moments of the grand finals. Did you have a specific strategy in mind to win? What tactics or moves were you focused on?OP: In the end, we faced WE Esports Armada. Luckily since we already faced them, we knew their strategy and focused on their weak points. We worked on that, executed our plan properly and won the final. Our one and only tactic are believing in your teammates.T: Are there any fun facts you can share with us about your gaming experience overall or playing Arena of Valor?OP:  Arena of Valor is one of the most balanced games. We have played many MOBA games, so sometimes we mix up certain terms, like saying ""lord"" instead of ""dragon.""T: Are there any memorable moments from your life and gaming life that you can share with us?OP: It was nice to spend time with our teammates during this tournament. We met Sycen for the first time, and as a team, we enjoyed our time playing together. We have arranged a get-together to celebrate as a team at the end of January.T: What does this victory mean to your team? What is your plan next?OP: This victory gives us inspiration, confidence and responsibility to represent Bangladesh. Now, our next plan is to win the Asian Olympics' trophy and other notable tournaments. We will work hard to represent BangladeshT: The Asian Olympics will host Arena of Valor, will your team participate in the grand event?OP: Participating in the Asian Olympics is our dream. Our journey is only just beginning since we won this tournament. We want to represent our nation through this game. This is our very first step to helping esports grow in our country.T: Any messages that you would like to give to Arena of Valor fans or amateur esports teams?OP: Participate in esports games and tournaments competitively. Make your own team and fight for your nation so you can represent your country to the whole world. Thanks to everyone for supporting us. Stay safe, stay health",tech_news
347,"The ransomware landscape will become both more modular and uniform in the coming days. It will continue to adapt to distribute and deliver ransomware. These findings were made public by Sophos, the global cybersecurity solutions provider, recently in their 'Sophos 2022 Threat Report'. The report also provides a unique multi-dimensional perspective on security threats and trends facing organisations in 2022.The report, written by SophosLabs security researchers, Sophos Managed Threat Response threat hunters and rapid responders, and the Sophos AI team, reveals key cyber threat trends from the past year citing multiple examples analysed by Sophos researchers.According to Sophos researchers, attacks by single ransomware groups gave way to more ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offerings during 2021, with specialist ransomware developers focused on hiring out malicious code and infrastructure to third-party affiliates. The report also states that the use of multiple forms of extortion by ransomware attackers to pressure victims into paying the ransom is expected to continue and increase in range and intensity. Cryptocurrency will continue to fuel cybercrimes such as ransomware and malicious crypto mining, and Sophos expects the trend will continue until global cryptocurrencies are better regulated. The report also predicts that the application of artificial intelligence to cybersecurity will continue and accelerate, as powerful machine learning models prove their worth in threat detection and alert prioritisation. At the same time, however, adversaries are expected to make increasing use of AI, progressing over the next few years from AI-enabled disinformation campaigns and spoof social media profiles to watering-hole attack web content, phishing emails and more as advanced deep-fake video and voice synthesis technologies become available""It is no longer enough for organisations to assume they're safe by simply monitoring security tools and ensuring they are detecting malicious code. Certain combinations of detections or even warnings are the modern equivalent of a burglar breaking a flower vase while climbing in through the back window. Defenders must investigate alerts, even ones which in the past may have been insignificant, as these common intrusions have blossomed into the foothold necessary to take control of entire networks,"" said Chester Wisniewski, Principal Research Scientist at Sophos.

349,"An American hacker by the name of P4x has hacked the nationwide internet access of North Korea, according to a report by the American magazine Wired. The cyber attack has reportedly caused connectivity issues all over North Korea for about two weeks and affected national sites such as the Air Koryo airline booking portal and the official website for Kim Jong-un's government. Reports further state that the attack had also temporarily paralysed one of the central routers of the country, which granted it digital access to the rest of the world.While choosing to remain anonymous, the hacker named P4x reached out to Wired and declared himself as the perpetrator of this massive cyber attack. Wired reports that P4x was the victim of a hacking campaign by the North Korean government held over a year ago, in which a number of Western security researchers were targeted. According to P4x, this recent attack was an act of vengeance, stating that ""it felt like the right thing to do"".P4x confirmed his role in the cyber attack by sharing screenshots as proof with Wired, and explained that he had found a number of unpatched vulnerabilities in North Korean servers. This enabled him to launch 'denial-of-service attacks', eventually halting the entire country's internet access and causing a near blackout on 26 January. Wired adds that this was relatively easy for the hacker to accomplish due to North Korea having very few internet-connected networks across its land. When asked about his intention, the hacker named P4x reportedly said, ""If they don't see we have teeth, it's just going to keep coming."" ""I want them to understand that if you come at us, it means some of your infrastructure is going down for a while,"" he further added. ",tech_news
350,"Mark Zuckerberg lost $29 billion in net worth on Thursday as Meta Platforms Inc's stock marked a record one-day plunge following a disappointing earnings forecast that shook the global tech landscape.Meta's stock fell 26 percent, erasing more than $200 billion in the biggest ever single-day market value wipeout for a US company. That pulled down founder and Chief Executive Officer Zuckerberg's net worth to $85 billion, according to Forbes.Zuckerberg owns about 12.8 percent of the tech behemoth formerly known as Facebook.His one-day wealth decline is among the biggest ever and comes after Tesla Inc top boss Elon Musk's $35 billion single-day paper loss in November. Musk, the world's richest person, had then polled Twitter users if he should sell 10 percent of his stake in the electric carmaker. Tesla shares have yet to recover from the resulting selloff.At least 21 brokerages cut price targets on Meta after the company posted a weaker-than-expected forecast on Wednesday, blaming Apple Inc's privacy changes and increased competition for users from rivals including TikTok and YouTube.Following the $29 billion wipeout, Zuckerberg is in the twelfth spot on Forbes' list of real-time billionaires, below Indian business moguls Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani.To be sure, trading in technology stocks remains volatile as investors struggle to price in the impact of high inflation and an expected rise in interest rates. Meta shares could very well recover sooner rather than later, with the hit to Zuckerberg's wealth staying on paper.Zuckerberg sold $4.47 billion worth of Meta shares last year, before 2021's tech rout. The stock sales were carried out as part of a pre-set 10b5-1 trading plan, which executives use to allay concerns about insider trading.",tech_news
351,"The new Honda Civic for 2022 is out, welcoming the 11th generation on their lineup which could almost be taken for an Accord; from a certain distance and after squinting hard enough. The new Civic debuts new body styling, interior design and features both in terms of driver aid and infotainment. This week, we got our hands on one and we finally got to drive the car. Keep reading to find out what more the new Honda Civic has to offer.The new bits
The new 11th gen Civic comes completely refreshed, with a new plaid design and interior bits and pieces where the Civic comes in four different packages sporting two different engine options; a 2L which comes in the base model and a 1.5L turbocharged made available for the higher trim levels. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
 








Our test mule was an EX package with the 1.5L version which is, ironically the only version available (including the EX touring package, of course) in Bangladesh as the base model comes with a 2L, which also has less power compared to the turbo and due to our taxation system, which is solely based on engine capacity, the base model will end up costing more than the top of the line Civic available.
A couple of other things to note is that the sedan version of the Civic does not offer a manual gearbox, it comes standard with a CVT; although if a manual transmission is absolutely necessary, there's the SI version available.
Exterior; a new generation
The exterior of the 11th gen Civic receives a dramatic design change which in retrospect, eliminates drama that was present in the last, introducing us to a new simpler, mature design language with easy to read straight body lines which end on the LED headlights with running DRLs, where the LEDs are a standard option through the whole lineup, even when it comes to the taillights.
 








Interior and infotainment
Jump inside the Civic and you will find everything well laid out in the right positions and since the car is targeted towards heavy commuters in general, Honda did not overcomplicate the knobs and buttons which the driver or the passengers will interact with.
Expect satisfactory materials used throughout the interior but since it's a Civic and not an Accord; do not expect Honda giving out genuine leather on the seats and wooden trim pieces. The seats in the Civic are roomy and although they are made of fabric, they come heated; and are manually operated, which is a bit of a bummer, but they still get the job well done.
As far as the climate control goes, it's controlled with a bunch of knobs where the air comes through a honeycomb mesh sandwiched between the infotainment system screen and the AC controls, which gets cold enough to tackle Dhaka weathers.
 








What sets apart the Civic from the bigger Accord is the obvious cost-cutting done from Honda. For example, the Piano black Trim pieces on the front doors of our test car had a light bar going in the middle of the piece but the rear doors do not have it, but that is just me being nitpicky. The back seats though are amazing for a commuter. They are comfortable and have enough legroom where you can stretch your legs and your knees will not touch the front seat. There's also an armrest with cup holders in the middle which also adds up as an extra seat when folded up.
Another feature which the new Civic has and I would like to see implemented in other cars as well as the feature to fold the seats directly from the boot of the car, which is a foolproof feature and contributes to extra convenience.
 








The infotainment system, on the other hand, has quite a lot to offer while maintaining simplicity; yet another effort from Honda not to overcomplicate what the user will interact with. It comes 7'' standard but it can be upgraded to a 9'' which usually comes in the LX package as standard. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also come standard which is always good to see. The sound is delivered through pairs of Bose speakers for the first time in a Civic, where the mids are well pronounced which makes the sound clear but it lacks a bit around the low end; the bass could be just a bit more satisfying but in the end, the mids make a satisfactory cut.
Driving the Civic
When you push the start button and finally start to drive the car, a noticeable feature is how visible everything is on the road and how open the ambience feels, mostly due to the sunroof, which allows a lot of light to enter inside the car which is always appreciated. Driving the actual car, the suspension in the Civic is brilliantly set where it takes small bumps at ease. The steering feels athletic where there is actual feedback when taking corners. The throttle response is great where the 1.5L turbo does not feel laggy and for a commuter, the 180hp and 240 Nm torque is plenty to feather with.
 








What intrigued Ahbaar Milky (in his own words) the most was how hard the CVT, when in sport mode, actually tried and successfully pretended to simulate 'gear shifts' akin to a DCT, albeit a sluggish one at that. Flick the drive mode selector downwards once and the digital cluster greets you with a dash of red, unlocking the joys of rowing through five simulated gears through the flappy paddles, which are ergonomically positioned just where your index fingers would grip the wheel when the hands are at 9 and 3. The paddles are tactile enough, having the same resistance and feel as the R1 and L1 buttons of a PlayStation controller, or a keyboard.
Expect horrible economy on sport mode, obviously, as the CVT forces the engine to work overtime with instant throttle response if you're lead-footed. On the contrary, Normal and Economy modes do a solid job of keeping the drive experience seamless for hypermiling.
 








Verdict
The new Civic is a great 'people's car' and it's the smallest details that make it just a bit more desirable all around. Driving the car does not feel like a chore and honestly, the whole package just makes sense. Although the E-Parking brake is the only thing that people could find annoying as it's small and the existence can easily slip off the dome (it happened twice with us).
Coupled with the fantastic dampening on bumpy Dhaka roads, and the no-nonsense yet bang up to date interior, the new civic is already leagues ahead of the previous generation in our book. We just wish the wireless Apple CarPlay would work without any glitches on our test vehicle. There's a wireless charging pad though which worked with no hiccups.

Expect horrible economy on sport mode, obviously, as the CVT forces the engine to work overtime with instant throttle response if you're lead-footed. On the contrary, Normal and Economy modes do a solid job of keeping the drive experience seamless for hypermiling.
 








Verdict
The new Civic is a great 'people's car' and it's the smallest details that make it just a bit more desirable all around. Driving the car does not feel like a chore and honestly, the whole package just makes sense. Although the E-Parking brake is the only thing that people could find annoying as it's small and the existence can easily slip off the dome (it happened twice with us).
Coupled with the fantastic dampening on bumpy Dhaka roads, and the no-nonsense yet bang up to date interior, the new civic is already leagues ahead of the previous generation in our book. We just wish the wireless Apple CarPlay would work without any glitches on our test vehicle. There's a wireless charging pad though which worked with no hiccups.
Jump inside the Civic and you will find everything well laid out in the right positions and since the car is targeted towards heavy commuters in general, Honda did not overcomplicate the knobs and buttons which the driver or the passengers will interact with.Expect satisfactory materials used throughout the interior but since it's a Civic and not an Accord; do not expect Honda giving out genuine leather on the seats and wooden trim pieces. The seats in the Civic are roomy and although they are made of fabric, they come heated; and are manually operated, which is a bit of a bummer, but they still get the job well done.As far as the climate control goes, it's controlled with a bunch of knobs where the air comes through a honeycomb mesh sandwiched between the infotainment system screen and the AC controls, which gets cold enough to tackle Dhaka weathers.What sets apart the Civic from the bigger Accord is the obvious cost-cutting done from Honda. For example, the Piano black Trim pieces on the front doors of our test car had a light bar going in the middle of the piece but the rear doors do not have it, but that is just me being nitpicky. The back seats though are amazing for a commuter. They are comfortable and have enough legroom where you can stretch your legs and your knees will not touch the front seat. There's also an armrest with cup holders in the middle which also adds up as an extra seat when folded up.Another feature which the new Civic has and I would like to see implemented in other cars as well as the feature to fold the seats directly from the boot of the car, which is a foolproof feature and contributes to extra convenience.The infotainment system, on the other hand, has quite a lot to offer while maintaining simplicity; yet another effort from Honda not to overcomplicate what the user will interact with. It comes 7'' standard but it can be upgraded to a 9'' which usually comes in the LX package as standard. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also come standard which is always good to see. The sound is delivered through pairs of Bose speakers for the first time in a Civic, where the mids are well pronounced which makes the sound clear but it lacks a bit around the low end; the bass could be just a bit more satisfying but in the end, the mids make a satisfactory cut.Driving the Civic
When you push the start button and finally start to drive the car, a noticeable feature is how visible everything is on the road and how open the ambience feels, mostly due to the sunroof, which allows a lot of light to enter inside the car which is always appreciated. Driving the actual car, the suspension in the Civic is brilliantly set where it takes small bumps at ease. The steering feels athletic where there is actual feedback when taking corners. The throttle response is great where the 1.5L turbo does not feel laggy and for a commuter, the 180hp and 240 Nm torque is plenty to feather with.
 








What intrigued Ahbaar Milky (in his own words) the most was how hard the CVT, when in sport mode, actually tried and successfully pretended to simulate 'gear shifts' akin to a DCT, albeit a sluggish one at that. Flick the drive mode selector downwards once and the digital cluster greets you with a dash of red, unlocking the joys of rowing through five simulated gears through the flappy paddles, which are ergonomically positioned just where your index fingers would grip the wheel when the hands are at 9 and 3.

352,"Many people are passionate about climate change, but not everybody should drive a battery electric vehicle as a means to combat climate change, Toyota Motor Corp Chief Scientist Gill Pratt said on Thursday at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit.Pratt's comments, during a discussion on electric vehicles, appeared to amplify remarks made over the past year by Toyota President Akio Toyoda.Toyota and other company officials have said that electric vehicles will play a greater role in reducing emissions, but other solutions should be used, Toyota's gasoline-electric hybrid models or hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles.At Thursday's conference, Pratt said Toyota believes in ""diversity of drivetrains"" to give customers different tools to reduce CO2.""It's not for us to predict which solution is the best or say only this will work,"" he said.Government incentives should be aimed at reducing carbon emissions, not picking which car technology is the best way to achieve those goals, Pratt added, in a reference to proposed bans on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, including hybrids, as a means of achieving carbon neutrality.Toyota was among major automakers that supported the Trump administration in its attempt to bar California from setting its own zero-emission requirements, but the company dropped that support earlier this year. Toyota has said it plans to invest $13.5 billion through 2030 on EV batteries, but so far its plans to roll out new battery electric vehicles (BEVs) seem relatively modest compared with those of US automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, which are spending around $30 billion each through 2025 to electrify more of their vehicle lines. Toyota executives continue to tout the merits of the company's hybrid vehicles, which have been on the market for more than 20 years.",tech_news

354,"Mercedes-Benz, the German company founded by the inventors of the motor car, is pouring more resources into its cutting-edge research and design capabilities in China as the centre of gravity of the new auto world shifts eastwards.In a drive to create a  ""home away from home"", Mercedes-Benz is doubling down on bases in Beijing and Shanghai to stay ahead of regulations and consumer trends in a car market that outstrips the United States and Germany combined.Three years after initially announcing plans to strengthen its research and development (R&D) in the country, the luxury car brand owned by Daimler will unveil its new Tech Center China in Beijing this month.Reuters has spoken to four people close to the tech centre and the brand's Chinese design studio who are familiar with the company's new China strategy. All declined to be named because they are not allowed to speak with the media.With 1,000 engineers, the new tech centre is more than three times the size of the one Mercedes-Benz opened in 2014 and the first outside Germany that can test  ""everything"", putting it more ""on par"" technically with the far bigger R&D headquarters near Stuttgart, a person close to the centre said.Mercedes-Benz has also invested significantly in upgrading its Chinese design studio and has moved the whole team from Beijing to Shanghai, a megalopolis of about 25 million people known as the car design capital of China.Mercedes-Benz has good reason to elevate its Chinese operations.Its car sales in China jumped 12% last year to a record 774,000 despite the pandemic, streets ahead of its next two markets, Germany on 286,000 and the United States with 275,000.
 About 80% of the cars it sold in China were also made there, typically with an array of China-only features and models, and Asia overall accounted for almost half its global sales in 2021.China's auto market, the biggest in the world since 2009, is expected to carry on growing steadily, with demand forecast to reach 35 million vehicles by about 2030 versus 25 million now.'SECOND HOME'  But Mercedes-Benz, like all foreign automakers in China, is under growing pressure from local EV startups such as Xpeng, Li Auto and Nio and their stylish vehicles with high-tech features tailored to Chinese consumers.That's why the German carmaker's  ""second home"" strategy for China is focused on making its design and technology more agile, responding quickly to the ever-shifting landscape and to firmly entrench the Mercedes-Benz brand, the four sources said.""The expectations in China are for the in-car experience to be served by a localised digital services ecosystem, and such solutions must be conceived and built by people that live in China and truly understand the mobile internet,"" Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai, said.Mercedes-Benz customers in China are 36 years old on average - roughly 20 years younger than in Germany - and are more tech-savvy, but they are also notoriously disloyal, hopping from brand to brand as trends shift.Mercedes has spent 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million) upgrading the centre, with much of the investment ensuring it can do an array of testing locally - rather than send new technologies back to the Sindelfingen headquarters in Germany.""A key reason for the expansion is to gain the proximity to those customers and their needs,"" the person close to the tech centre said.  ""Here, we finally have everything we need to test the car fully,"" said the source.The centre has modern chassis test benches and others including for noise, vibration and harshness, as well as batteries and e-drive powertrains and it has the flexibility to swap in new ones as technology develops, two sources said.Mercedes has also added functions deemed important for Chinese customers, such as a team dedicated to intelligent, connected electric vehicle (EV) technology.""Tech-savvy customers here require that you're very local in terms of intelligence, connectivity and autonomous driving,"" one of the sources said.THINK ROSE GOLD  All four sources said a sharper focus on the customer in China in recent years is already paying off.A drive to create China-only colours led to research into the preferences of younger luxury goods buyers. While sensitive to being seen as hip and tech-savvy, there has been a revived interest in styles inspired by China's ancient dynasties.As part of that research, the studio came up with ""rose gold metallic"", a variation on rose gold tones adjusted for cars first used as an exterior colour for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class L sedan in 2018. New EVs such as the EQA and EQB now come in rose gold, and it's also an interior tone in the EQC.""Global ideas, inspired by China,"" said one source close to the studio, adding that while Mercedes needs to cater to its China customers first, some China-grown ideas will go global.Moving the studio to Shanghai was partly driven by the need to significantly speed up the design process by making it more digital, as most virtual model-making vendors are based there.""Besides, Shanghai is a lot easier a place to recruit design talent,"" said the source close to the studio, which is just north of the city's prime waterfront district The Bund.Designers typically sketch a car on paper or a touch-sensitive computer screen and expert modellers then help sculpt the designs into clay models. Mercedes-Benz plans to more or less do away with those physical models.Under the new process, the Shanghai studio will review its designs using virtual tools, except for the occasional quarter-size physical models, according to one of the four sources.If the studio makes it to the final of internal competitions for car designs, it will send designers and modellers to the main studio in Germany to create life-size models for the last round, the source said.RULES OF THE ROAD  Daimler's drive to strengthen its technology development in China also comes at a time when the cost of failing to be in step with Beijing policymakers has never been higher.Beijing's sweeping regulatory crackdown in recent months has wiped billions of dollars off the value of some of the country's best-known private firms and has weighed on the auto sector.That's partly because tensions between the United States and China have created a tricky environment for foreign companies to import technology developed elsewhere.And from battery technology to new kinds of mobility including smart connectivity and autonomous driving, Chinese policies and regulations are shifting and evolving rapidly.""If you respond to change after policies and regulation kick in, it's too late,"" said one of the contacts close to Daimler.With that in mind, the tech centre works closely with the brand's external affairs team which keeps its finger on the regulatory pulse - and that has proved key when it comes to so-called vehicle-to-everything, or V2X, technology.V2X controls communications between a car and  ""everything"" outside, from 5G cellular signals to low-earth-orbit satellites to smart traffic lights and cameras on the road.In China, vehicles will soon have to come with full-fledged V2X capabilities to achieve a top safety ranking under a new version of its vehicle safety evaluation system, or New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which is expected in 2025.""We knew this regulation was going to be implemented. We started developing those self-drive technologies including V2X to be in compliance with the new law and did so well before new regulation kicks in,"" one of the tech centre sources said.

357,"Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc's shares plunged more than 20 percent late on Wednesday after the social media company posted a weaker-than-expected forecast, blaming Apple's privacy changes and increased competition for users from rivals like TikTok.Facebook's global daily active users declined from the previous quarter for the first time, to 1.929 billion from 1.930 billion.Meta said it faced hits from Apple Inc's privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram. It also cited macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions.The 18-year-old tech giant, which also faces pressure from platforms like TikTok and Google's YouTube, said it expected slowing revenue growth in the coming quarter due to increased competition for users' time and a shift of engagement toward such features as its short video offering Reels, which generate less revenue.Facebook reported 2.91 billion monthly active users in the fourth quarter, showing no growth compared with the previous quarter.The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion of its market value, while peers Twitter Inc, Snap Inc and Pinterest Inc lost another $15 billion in value.Shares of Alphabet Inc, which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down nearly 2 percent.Meta, owner of the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter.Meta's chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, told analysts on a conference call that the impact of Apple's privacy changes could be ""in the order of $10 billion"" for 2022.Apple's changes to its operating software give users the choice to prevent apps from tracking their online activity for ads, making it harder for advertisers that rely on data to develop new products and know their market.Meta forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.""It's clear that there are many big roadblocks ahead as Meta faces tough new competition for ad revenue such as TikTok, and as it contends with ongoing ad targeting and measurement challenges from Apple's iOS changes,"" said Insider Intelligence analyst Debra Aho Williamson.The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.""I'm encouraged by the progress we made this past year in a number of important growth areas like Reels, commerce, and virtual reality, and we'll continue investing in these and other key priorities in 2022 as we work towards building the metaverse,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the earnings release.In Meta's earnings call, he said competition for users was one factor impacting the business, mentioning short video app TikTok by name and emphasizing Meta's commitment to providing services for young adults.Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results.Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future.""Reality Labs posted revenue of about $2.3 billion in 2021. The company has not made public the sales numbers for its virtual reality Quest headsets.The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play. Meta did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF.The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet.""Investors looking at Meta are starting to realize that buying their stock is no longer mostly an investment into their ad platform,"" said Flynn Zaiger, CEO of social media agency Online Optimism. ""Investing in Meta now looks more like a commitment that you believe that the metaverse will replace much of the internet consumers' experience today.""Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms.",tech_news

362,"US government scientists said on Wednesday they have taken an important step in the long trek toward making nuclear fusion - the very process that powers stars - a viable energy source for humankind.Using the world's largest laser, the researchers coaxed fusion fuel for the first time to heat itself beyond the heat they zapped into it, achieving a phenomenon called a burning plasma that marked a stride toward self-sustaining fusion energy.The energy produced was modest - about the equivalent of nine nine-volt batteries of the kind that power smoke detectors and other small devices. But the experiments at a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory facility in California represented a milestone in the decades-long quest to harness fusion energy, even as the researchers cautioned that years of more work are needed.The experiments produced the self-heating of matter in a plasma state through nuclear fusion, which is the combining of atomic nuclei to release energy. Plasma is one of the various states of matter, alongside solid, liquid and gas.""If you want to make a camp fire, you want to get the fire to hot enough that the wood can keep itself burning,"" said Alex Zylstra, an experimental physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory - part of the US Energy Department - and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature.""This is a good analogy for a burning plasma, where the fusion is now starting to become self-sustaining,"" Zylstra said.The scientists directed 192 laser beams toward a small target containing a capsule less than a tenth of an inch (about 2 mm) in diameter filled with fusion fuel consisting of a plasma of deuterium and tritium - two isotopes, or forms, of hydrogen.At very high temperatures, the nucleus of the deuterium and the nucleus of the tritium fuse, a neutron and a positively charged particle called an ""alpha particle"" - consisting of two protons and two neutrons - emerge, and energy is released.""Fusion requires that we get the fuel incredibly hot in order for it to burn - like a regular fire, but for fusion we need about a hundred million degrees (Fahrenheit). For decades we've been able to cause fusion reactions to occur in experiments by putting a lot of heating into the fuel, but this isn't good enough to produce net energy from fusion,"" Zylstra said.""Now, for the first time, fusion reactions occurring in the fuel provided most of the heating - so fusion is starting to dominate over the heating we did. This is a new regime called a burning plasma,"" Zylstra said.Unlike burning fossil fuels or the fission process of existing nuclear power plants, fusion offers the prospect of abundant energy without pollution, radioactive waste or greenhouse gases. Nuclear fission energy comes from splitting atoms. Fusion energy comes from fusing atoms together, just like inside stars, including our sun.Private-sector ventures - dozens of companies and institutions- also are pursuing a fusion energy future, with some oil companies even investing.""Fusion energy is the holy grail of clean limitless energy,"" said Annie Kritcher of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, lead designer for the experiments conducted in 2020 and 2021 at the National Ignition Facility and first author of a companion paper published in the journal Nature Physics.In these experiments, fusion produced about 10 times as much energy as went into heating the fuel, but less than 10% of the total amount of laser energy because the process remains inefficient, Zylstra said. The laser was used for only about 10 billionths of a second in each experiment, with fusion production lasting 100 trillionths of a second, Kritcher added.Zylstra said he is encouraged by the progress.""Making fusion a reality is an enormously complex technological challenge, and it will require serious investment and innovation to make it practical and economical,"" Zylstra said. ""I view fusion as a decadal-scale challenge for it to be a viable source of energy.""",tech_news

369,"Namira Huq Badhon, previously known for her incredible success as a dress and jewellery designer, talks about her aspirations of working with transgenders ever since she was a child herself.
""I would often see people making fun of transgenders and their overdone faces. I sensed their love for makeup and beauty and thought that this line of work may be good for them,"" said Namira Huq Badhon.She maintains that her actual profession still is designing, but that Namira delved into beauty for to give these unconventional and marginalised individuals a chance to look beautiful and earn a respectable livelihood through beauty. Namira Huq has meticulously trained herself in the art by taking a variety of beauty and makeup courses, her most recent one being with international makeup artist, Michelly Palma. She is now a certified international makeup artist herself.
""The ultimate goal is to set up a beauty salon which will be run by third gender individuals so that they can earn through it. My foray into the makeup world is only to help them,"" said Namira.While attractive, transgender facial structures are somewhat unconventional. The skin texture too, is somewhere between that of a male and a female. Namira understands the intricate nature of her work when it comes to practicing makeovers on their faces.
""The makeup world is yet to bring out any product specifically for this rare skin quality. An extra layer of a customised base mix is needed for them — I make it myself, using a few different products,"" Namira explained.  
Sometimes, the facial structure needs to be sculpted a little more to bring out the femininity as well. ""Some of these women have exceptional skin naturally, and most improve once they start using products that regulate hormones and reduce facial hair growth,"" added Namira.The makeup artist is in the beginning stages of her project with transgender women. She has invited members of the transgender community to speak at her events and is trying to train them the tricks of the makeup and grooming trade.
""It is a big undertaking and it will take some time to come to fruition. So far, they love how I make them look and how I train them to groom others,"" she said.The Honourable Prime Minister has done much for them and in the last five years, the third gender has gained importance and power in different sectors of this country.
""There is no end to success. One wants more of it each time. I've just chosen to share mine with my transgender friends,"" reflected Namira Huq Badhon.",life_living
370,"Entrepreneurial stories about women shining and making it big has become quite the norm these days. With Farnaz Alam, we have a comparable story of excellence where the creative makeup artist leaves a prominent mark in the much-coveted global beauty industry. Today, as DMD of Woman's World Ltd, CEO of WW Cosmetics, and founder of Kona by Farnaz Alam, she wears quite a few hats. Nevertheless, these responsibilities only encourage her to achieve more and gain myriad prestigious titles to her name.
""My beauty journey began with the L'Oreal Paris Brush Contest; later, I took part in the London Fashion Week as a certified MUA. These opportunities gave me enough encouragement to think big and achieve more,"" said the veteran makeup artist.
This is when Farnaz Alam ventured into developing her own makeup line, Kona by Farnaz Alam, after three long years of research and development. And Alam had to never look back on the progress.
""My mother, Kona Alam, had already created a platform for me in Bangladesh. It was my duty to take it a few steps further and that's why I am trying to etch my name in the international arena. As a newbie, who has started afresh in a brand-new platform, I consider myself extremely lucky because beauty giants of the industry have already noticed my efforts,"" revealed Alam.

372,"In Bengal, there is a flower for every season. From serving as offerings at the altars of deities while the priest chants shlokas for pujas, to styling a beautiful bride on her wedding day, to simply using them to decorate households on opportune occasions — there is a flower befitting every occasion!There is nothing more mesmerising than the look of a Bengali bride with a rose bloom tucked on the sides of her bun, and milky white beli garlands hanging by. Nothing more auspicious than the sight of dainty maloti gracing the feet of various Hindu deities, nothing more delightful than the sight of rojonigandha, neatly arranged in a vase in a family living.Pijush Kanti Sarkar is an art teacher and designer by profession, and flower aficionado by passion. He says that growing flowers has everything to do with the right soil. The fertile grounds of Bengal suit certain flowers more than others, and thus, they are found in abundance in this region. Although now grown in other parts of the world as well, like in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, most of these blooms can truly be attributed as 'Bengali.''Through our poetry, songs and art, to our cultural decoration and veneration, we own these flowers!"" exclaimed Sarkar. ""There are flowers that one can see the year round and then there are those that only visit us seasonally.""And he went on to explain, ""The beli and the jasmine are both flowers of spring. The dolonchapa and nayantara are mostly seen in monsoon. Marigolds, as we all know, bloom in winter. The nagalingam and the konokchapa, for instance, grow well in the dry soils of the mountainous regions like the Chittagong Hill Tracks, and then there are other flowers that grow well in moist soils found in the lowlands, like Barishal, for example,"" he explained passionately.Certain flowers have flourished in various regions of the country because of people's fondness for them. In Hindu majority areas, due to their preferences and veneration practices, some flowers are grown in the households.""One may see flowers like shondha maloti and aparajita around Hindu localities more than in other places. Durga or Lakshmi Puja will be deemed incomplete without the lotus. There will be no Kalipuja without the roktojoba (the blood red hibiscus). Some deities are fond of the shade blue, so aparajitas and other blue coloured flowers are used in certain Hindu religious ceremonies,"" he said.Even culturally, Pijush Kanti Sarkar mentions that it was once common practice to bring in fresh blooms of palash or shimul every Pahela Baishakh to symbolise freshness, peace, and prosperity for the coming year.""Although a lost practice now, it was a big part of the Baishakhi celebrations back in our time,"" he added.However, it is not only religion and culture that dictates flower cultivation in Bengal. There are other practical reasons for it too. ""Flowers such as nayantara have a range of health benefits. In fact, the nayantara has cancer fighting properties and has also been called a miracle in the prevention of childhood leukaemia. Similarly, the juice from marigold leaves is thought to stop severe haemorrhage from wounds, and aparajita petals are gaining popularity as a drink for boosting memory and relieving anxiety. Full of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances, aparajita also helps in keeping diabetes in check,"" added the enthusiast.Flowers have something in them for everyone. Some get drawn to their beauty and vivacity, some to their freshness and fragrance. Inside Bangladesh and in the wider Bengal, flowers hold symbolism and bring in health benefits for those who take the time to dig deep and learn more about these beautiful ornaments of nature.

And just as the trees begin to put on a show, the palash or the flame of the forest comes ablaze in vermilion, birds begin nesting on the green leaves, the eager bees and the cuckoos instigate an orchestral magnificence.

374,"Mahia Ninan Poushee, a young, effervescent fashion designer of 26 talks about how she stumbled onto fashion and where she plans to take it next.For Poushee, fashion was a chance meeting. Her first love was photography. However, as she began making dresses for herself and modelling them on Facebook, she realised that people really liked what she was wearing and were willing to pay for it. With a paltry investment of Tk 10000, Poushee made a few dresses and put them up on her profile one night — happy if they sold, happy if they didn't. Little did she know that she would wake up and in 12 hours find everything sold clean. After that, she never looked back.""My father was furious!"" muses Poushee. ""He wanted me to join a particular school and follow a particular profession. And here I was, at 19, selling dresses and making money!""Between fits of laughter, Poushee reminisces how opposed her father was to her calling in the beginning and a few years later, how he became her pillar of support, pushing her to join fashion school and hone her skills.Poushee credits social media engagement for her successes.""Most of my work got recognised on Facebook. From getting my first paid order to finding partners for my first shop in Banani — Kayara — to being able to send off hundreds of pieces to Italy, every opportunity found me via Facebook.""I was a fledgling still. I had no idea how exports work, what quality checks were. I learned everything on the job.""Poushee is the billboard for her own work.""I'm most comfortable in pants and a t-shirt. But when I go out socially, I make sure I wear my own pieces and I dress so well that it compels people to buy the piece from me. Even when I am on a tour — what you see in pictures is all about my work. I know when I make the pieces that I should be able to sell them.""When Poushee realised that formal wear fashions from China were leading the market demand, she decided to cater to it.""I create the entire look, from the innerwear to the upper and bottom, and that's when the customers can visualise how they can wear my creations.""A strong believer of inclusivity, Poushee has recently started venturing into plus-sized fashion.""I want everyone to wear my creations — not just skinny people.""The young designer worked hard to get measurements correct for larger sizes.""I have it down to a T now. Just tell me what size you wear and I can nail down the perfect measurement. There are hardly instances where any tweaking is required anymore.""Poushee is all for quality as well.""I have been known to turn down hefty profits if I was unsure about the quality of the product I am delivering.""The young designer feels that fashion is a necessary part of life in any era.""Everywhere you go, people will notice you. Make sure they notice you for the right reason."" she quips. To this effect, she holds consultations with her clients about the right looks for them and provides them custom-made attire, blending their choices with her expertise.She plans to diversify into designing eastern dresses and other fashion genre come Eid, this year. To the fashion students, she has a few potent words of advice — ""Work on developing your taste. This industry has a lot to do with trends, the more knowledge you gain on recent and upcoming trends, the wider your imagination and taste develops. If you are going to take inspiration from a famous piece of work, try to surpass the original.""Some of her work featured here includes a dress with embellishments and creative sleeve work in ice blue, a jumpsuit in tan with a cross body bow, pantsuits with cropped and worked innerwear in bright hues like yellow and orange, a white two-piece number with an attached cape, a powerful pantsuit with a bunched and cropped inner and leg slits in a metallic shade of grey and finally, a creative patchwork jacket with puffed sleeves in ochre.Photo: Sazzad Ibne Sayed

375,"The epitome of humble beginnings, the jumpsuit was literally a one-piece worn by parachuters to jump from planes, earning it its name. Created in 1919 as a functional garment, it never really took off in the world of fashion until the 1960s when it appeared to have gone through quite the metamorphosis. It appeared in the Vogue, a statement black number designed by Yves Saint Laurent and from then on, there was no turning back for this one-piece wonder.The jumpsuit really had its moment in the sun in the late '60s and '70s, with athletes and dancers wearing the comfortable piece for work time and disco goers donning the unisex attire in the evening with equal zeal. The jumpsuit has been hanging around the fashion scene ever since and now it is considered to be that one golden piece from the seasons past that has held on fast. If anything, it has become even more trendy.Jumpsuits can be simple or embellished and there is a lot to play around with. The necklines for instance.Halter necks can make the simplest outfits stand out and collar embellishments can 'bling up' the plainest of the suits. Capes on the jumpsuits add more drama to the attire by giving it a business-like polish. And then there are the pants — slim fits versus wide palazzos can make all the difference between a formal and casual look.There is another specialty of the one-piece suit. It works on all body types. It gives glamour to long legs and length to short ones. It has a slimming effect on rounder figures and makes even the slightest frames look filled out and noticeable. It can add style and appeal to women who wish to turn heads without showing much skin.The jumpsuit is a versatile garment that one can wear to parties, family dinners, workplaces or to outdoor events like a friendly neighbourhood barbeque. In vogue literally everywhere and with styles that vary to suit every kind of event, the jumpsuit is adaptable and worth a buy or two. Some of the most common jumpsuit styles are blazer jumpsuits, boiler suits, cape jumpsuits, culotte jumpsuits, flared jumpsuits, sweatshirt and tank jumpsuits.Blazer jumpsuits are the ones that give you that extra professional oomph while at work. With a blazer neckline, and paired with light jewellery and heels, this outfit is one of the best official looks for those who have a pear-shaped body.Boiler suits, in direct contrast to the blazer, are sporty and maxed out on comfort. Made with plain nylon or denim material, with slight detailing on the waist, a clinched pant and deep pockets, this suit makes an uber cool style statement, especially when worn with sneakers.Cape jumpsuits recreate the blazer-over-shoulders look with an attached cape. The flirty look is great for office wear as well as evening cocktail attire. With boat or V-neck, this stylish number takes away attention from the top and arms and add the touch of glamour to the shoulders.Cullote jumpsuits usually sport rounder or higher necklines and higher hemlines. This cut-off hemline is what makes this style popular among the petite framed women, as it creates the illusion of long legs, especially when paired with heels or wedges.Creating a jazzy, snazzy party look is the flared jumpsuit style where one can experiment all they want with the sleeves or pants. Go off shoulder, bare one shoulder, add frills or high-low flares on the hems— make it your style canvas.Sweatshirt jumpsuits and tank jumpsuits are both informal attires that can be sported with hoods or without. The slight difference between a tank jumpsuit and a sweatshirt jumpsuit is simply what their names imply — a tank jumpsuit looks like a tank top while a sweatshirt jumpsuit is made of warmer material, creating scope for this summery style in winter. Photo: Sazzad Ibne SayedModel: SurjoWardrobe: PousheeMakeup: MasumStyling: Sonia Yeasmin IshaLocation: Radisson Blu Dhaka Water Garden",life_living

380,"Frequently, we receive patients in our chambers with heaps of frustrations that they are starving and depriving their body and souls, suffocating the desire for food, but still failing to make any substantial positive results in terms of weight reduction. Fallaciously, taking foods containing concentrated calories are primarily responsible for this. Whenever one is under a diet plan, whether to reduce weight or due to any other clinical issues, it's very important to ascertain foods of fewer and higher calorie. In our country, there are some vastly preferred common foods which are taken usually just as a snack, but contains good amount of calories. Puffed rice (muri), toast biscuits, dates, nuts, banana, suji, flattened rice flakes (chira), and any deep fried items are just some on this list of calorie-heavy food.Banana is the most available fruit in our country which contains a good number of calories and carb. For patients who are under weight-reducing diets or diabetic, it must not be considered as a fruit but rather a portion of carb, though it is packed with high nutritional value. Fruit juices are more desirable than whole fruits especially for kids. Because of the lack of fibre, fruit juices carry more calories than the fruits. High fibre fruits and vegetables helps us reduce the daily calorie intake. It also improves the satiety level and reduce hunger pangs. Dried fruits like dates, raisin, prunes, and dried mango pulp are rich source of good amount of calories which are just random finger food for many families in the city area. Anyone who wants to get rid of hidden calories must be aware of high glycaemic index fruits and vegetables. Mango, litchi, jackfruits, grapes, pomegranate, potato, carrot, yam, sweet pumpkin, (all root and tuber vegetables) contain a high glycaemic index. They need to limit the intake of these to restrict the calorie.Olive oil has enormous health benefits, like reducing bad cholesterol, boost the immune system etc. but also contain high calories. One teaspoon carries about 45kcal. So, having too much olive oil to enjoy its heath benefit would backfire on any weight reduction initiatives. Measurement and restriction in oil should get the highest priority in a low calorie meal plan. The most common mistake that people make is to reduce carb, protein and other categories of food, without keeping count of their daily oil intake through cooking. Oil is the most calorie dense nutrient in the food world. Another calorie dense food item is table sugar. A slight difference in the amount of sugar in a recipe can make a considerable change in the amount of total calories.Nuts are an abundant source of protein and good fat but they are categorically calorific. So, a handful of nuts everyday on and off would be a good reason for failure in weight management. Chanachur is a highly popular snack item which is rich in both fat and carb. And as it's a dried food, one can take in huge amounts while in social settings with friends and family.Serving wise, puffed rice (muri) and rice flakes (chira) contain all the nutrients of rice and the same amount of calories except the moisture. Two cups of rice are equal to four cups of puffed rice (muri). But puffed rice doesn't provide hunger-satiety like rice. The same applies to toast biscuits and bread. Two to three slices of bread could be the carbohydrate part of a main meal whereas toast biscuit, which contain the same ingredients and calorie is most of the time eaten in good numbers as a snack.Dairy cream and thick mayo, butter, ghee and sauces add extensive calories to an otherwise healthy meal. These are often high in sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Pick the options lower in calories and sugar such as mustard, vinegar, lime juice, hot sauce, garlic, herbs, and spices are almost calorie-free, contain antioxidants and offer lots of flavours. It would also be helpful to cut the extra calorie from a meal and make the meal much healthier.Photo: LS Archive/Sazzad Ibne Sayed

381,"Winter is an important season, especially for those of us who have big appetites and zero regard for blood cholesterol levels. Luckily for us, there happens to be a vast selection of delicacies to enjoy this winter. So, if you want a quick rundown on the best chow this season, look no further.Eating on the go
Pitha carts are a common sight during this season. The variety of pithas, from the sweet jaggery filled bhapa pitha to the savoury chitoi pitha, is truly astounding.
Another street food people enjoy during the winter is bhutta or corn on the cob. They are usually served boiled or grilled. A great choice for an evening snack, if you do not mind getting kernels stuck between your teeth. Haleem, a type of meaty stew, is also found year-round but during the winter, it ""hits different.""A healthier alternative?
However, if you are the type of person that cares about health, I advise not subsisting on a diet of street food.
Cauliflower and cabbage are the two most iconic winter vegetables and when prepared properly, are also the two most delicious.
Cauliflowers are a great addition for both fish and meat curries as they add different textures while also absorbing tonnes of flavours. Veggies like green peas, broccoli and carrots are not only packed with nutrients but are also good for you. Dark leafy greens like palong shak are great for your skin and they even help with preventing heart diseases.A meal fit for kings
Let's say you want to satiate your inner glutton and diced veggies are not exactly doing it for you. In that case, one must turn to a timeless classic, hasher mangsho i.e., duck meat bhuna.
Ducks have a richer flavour profile than chicken. Spicy duck curry with some rice or paratha is guaranteed to heat you up during winter. There are a multitude of ways to prepare duck meat, but it is advised to slice off the excess fat and cook it long and slow. This helps to soften the meat and enhance the flavour.
While Duck bhuna is a classic recipe, many people are also using their ovens to roast duck meat instead. A properly roasted duck will result in crispy golden skin and juicier meat.Rooftop cookouts
If you have been on social media the past two weeks, you know exactly what I am talking about — literally hundreds of Instagram stories of people having rooftop parties. Other than actively trying to light up Dhaka city like a tinder box, another recent new year's celebration trend is the rooftop BBQ party trend.
Obviously in order to do this, you need to have an actual grill and the knowledge to operate one without setting the building on fire. Using charcoal or woodchips, pieces of marinated chicken are cooked quickly over a live fire. This creates not only tender and flavourful meat but also gives the chicken a certain smoky flavour.
While people may enjoy cold treats like juice and ice cream more during the summer, winter is still the season for foodies. The rich flavours and decadence of a winter feast even now are without compare.

382,"Take a break to take care of yourself. We spend so much of our time working and taking care of others that we neglect our own selves. It slips our mind that we can only take better care of others when we ourselves feel our best.
Self-care often takes a backseat in our lives. However, nurturing our own body, mind, and soul is imperative to living a more satisfied and successful life. Therefore, leave behind all feelings of guilt and take some time to focus on yourself and only yourself, if not every day, then at least a few times a week.How to self-care
Self-care is referred to addressing the needs of our mind, body, and soul. Exercise, meditation, eating healthy, gardening, crafting, reading, listening to music, relaxing at a spa, journaling, talking to friends, etc. are all different ways to nourish our body and mind. Different things and techniques work for different people.
Upoma Haq, a Senior Vice President at a multinational bank in Bangladesh, says that walking has been critical to her well-being, both physical and emotional.
""There was a point when I poured myself into work and did nothing else. That was a type of escapism, but not a long-term solution to your life's problems,"" she said. She also now consciously reaches out to her close friends and meets up with them to feel light and happy. 
Even at workplace, one becomes less productive and less creative, if they stop looking after themselves and addressing their emotional needs.
""Because you are not meeting new people or experiencing new things, you cannot bring fresh ideas to the table,"" Upoma Haq said. 
Haseen Cherry, a UK-based microbiologist of Bangladeshi descent, says that as a professional woman and mother of two children, her daily life is immensely stressful. In addition to walking 12,000 steps every day, video-chatting with friends, reading, and listening to music, she regularly takes care of her skin and hair as ways to self-care.
""I also wear nice clothes and light make-up to work to feel more confident,"" she said. ""All this makes me happy, too!""   
In 2020, terms related to 'self-care' reached an all-time high on Google Trends, which means that more and more people across the globe were searching for ideas to take better care of their physical and emotional health. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown conditions showed us the importance of self-care as we struggled to stay physically and mentally healthy in a time of isolation.The long-term effect of self-care
Thirteen years ago, Rezwan Md Chowdhury weighed a whopping 119 kg, today he not only weighs just 68 kg, but also feels happier and healthier than he ever did.
How did he do this?
Through walking, running, exercising, and changing his food habit. The day Chowdhury fathomed the seriousness of self-care, he never looked back. From a young man who used to take medication for hypertension and insulin to control his blood sugar levels, he, who is now in his late-thirties, runs four half marathons (21.1km) four times a week! He no longer takes any kind of medicine, leads a stress-free life, and is more productive and focused at work.
Rezwan Md Chowdhury, who is the Head of Internet Business at Grameenphone Ltd., wakes up before anyone else in his house. The first 30 minutes to one hour of his day, he exclusively dedicates to himself. ""That first hour of the day is mine. I use that time to read, listen to podcasts, walk, run and/or exercise,"" he said. ""The quality of my life began to improve the day I decided to take charge of my mental and physical well-being.""
""It was not easy, but self-care is something worth giving a try, because if you do not take care of yourself, you cannot take care of others,"" he added.
Setting priorities in life is important to be happy and healthy. However, most of us do not realise that it should be our top priority to take good care of ourselves. As a result, we neglect ourselves and our well-being day after day. Eventually, we reach a point where we become frustrated with life and everything that we do for the people around us.
We think that we are only giving but not getting anything or enough in return. This bitterness and frustration with life, however, would not have happened, if we gave importance to our physical and emotional wellness from the beginning.
Do not feel guilty, if you set aside an hour of your day to do something that you enjoy, to take care of yourself, to unwind, or to spend some time with yourself. This is the time when you should not be available for anyone, but yourself, exclusively.",life_living
383,"Your sleep needs vary widely — total hours required, optimal bedtimes, and ideal wakeup times, these are all dictated by an individual's physiology, genetics, exercise levels, diet, and age group. Even the habits you formed as a child are influencing bed time habits, but whatever your needs are, getting adequate and effective sleep is crucial for your optimal daily functioning.What does sleep do for you?Neuro-science tells us that the space between brain cells increases during sleep, giving the brain the ability to clear toxins. Your brain forms new pathways for memory and knowledge acquisition and consolidates the learnings you accumulated during the day. After a good night's sleep, you have a greater attention span, make quicker decisions, and are more creative.Physically, your body uses this time for organ repair — your heart, blood vessels, skeletal muscles, etc. While you are sleeping, your body has the time to produce more white blood cells that are necessary to strengthen and maintain your immune system. Benefits of your daily exercise routine are generated through your sleep cycle. Sleep also regulates hormones related to hunger (ghrelin) and satiety (leptin).Problems with poor quality sleepDo you feel hungry late at nights? This comes to no surprise because staying awake late nights will force your sugar cravings through the roof. Your body has its own biological clock, the Circadian rhythm. Sleep and wake times are built into your DNA. Once you force your brain to stay awake longer than it should, you are forcing it to look for a quick source of energy.Sleep also affects the way insulin is regulated in your body. Imbalances of insulin, ghrelin, leptin, and other hormones can impact metabolism, calorie consumption, and body weight, affecting many aspects of health, wellness, performance, and personality on a day-to-day basis.Tips for effective sleepAt the end of the day, you are as efficient as your sleep. In order to boost your body and brain performance, sleep is your number one tool to transform into your best self.Get sunlight by going outside within 30-60 minutes of waking up.Do that again in the late afternoon, prior to sunset. Sunlight on skin promotes serotonin (hormone that promotes calm and focus) which is converted to melatonin (sleep hormone).Wake up at the same time each day and go to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy.Going to sleep too late is one reason people wake in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. Switch to decaf coffees and caffeine-free organic energy boosters.Avoid viewing bright lights — especially bright overhead lights between 10PM and 4AM. Here is a simple rule: only use as much artificial lighting as is necessary for you to remain and move about safely at night. Viewing bright lights of all colours are a problem for your Circadian system. Candlelight and moonlight are fine.Use your nutrition to nourish your body with magnesium rich organic foods that do not cause inflammation on your body.Trans fat (oils) and sugars are disturbing the balance of your hormones. Focus on quality organic proteins and essential fats.Clear your mind!Unload your brain by writing down what bothers you. This will help organise your thoughts and make daunting tasks easy.Photo: Marina Farook

384,"Winter can be pretty harsh. Perhaps the most annoying thing about winter is how it affects your skin. And the skin on your lips suffers the most because it is thinner and more delicate. By following a few instructions, you can care for your lips and have them looking healthy and plump even in winter.Use a lip balmThe cold winter air is dry and takes a toll on your lips by extracting moisture from them. This causes the lips to get dry easily and can result in chapped lips; something that is to be avoided at all cost. Using a lip balm can be very helpful for this issue. The balm can moisturise your lips and even create a protective barrier that should protect your lips from the harsh winter air for hours. After a few hours, you might feel the need to reapply and it is recommended that you do so. Try to carry lip balm with you that can be used at all times. Do not lick your lipsIt is very tempting, I know. Done in hopes to get temporary moisture on your lips, in hopes that it will last you a few more hours without using lip balm. It does not. Not only it fails to work as a substitute for a lip balm, licking your lips causes the lips to get even drier as soon as the saliva evaporates; which happens very quickly. This might be a habit for many. But whether you are doing it on purpose or not, try to avoid it as much as you can.Overnight careWhen you are awake, you will be applying lip balms a few times a day but we can't do that if we are asleep. This means the lips will remain unattended for at least 8 hours. That is more than enough time to get dry and chapped lips. It is recommended that you use a generous amount of lip balm or lip oil before you go to sleep. Diluted glycerine can be used as well. If you are wearing lipstick, take the extra few minutes to remove the lipstick before going to bed. If possible, try to exfoliate once a week.Avoid peelingSome people have the habit of pinching and plucking the dry skin on the lips little by little. Some enjoy peeling it all together. Either way, it should be avoided if you care about having healthy lips at all. Not only it exposes the layer beneath the dry skin, it can result in bleeding and even infection.Stay HydratedLast but not least, staying hydrated is as important as any skin care routine. People do not sweat much in the winter, as a result they tend to drink less water. Which is one of the reasons we get dry skin and lips. Drinking plenty of water is highly recommended for healthy skin and lips. Remember, dry and chapped lips look very unappealing and can cause awkward situations but these can be avoided if you take a few minutes of your day to care for you lips. Take the time to care for yourself. And if things get bad even after caring for your lips, consider visiting a dermatologist.  Photo: LS Archive/Sazzad Ibne Sayed",life_living
385,"Mental health condition is an important aspect of our existence. It incorporates everything from our emotional state of being to our psychological and social well-being. Our mental health, positive or negative, affects how we think, make life changing decisions or even who we choose to be friends with. It is extremely important at every stage of our lives, from early childhood through adolescence to even adulthood. 
There is no way, that we can skip maintenance of our psychiatric needs at any given point and still expect to live healthy and functioning lives.
""And this message needs to get through,"" says Rehnuma- E-Jannat, Psychological Counsellor, PHWC (Psychological Health and Wellness Clinic).  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Shabab Sabbir, a 28-year-old from Wari, Old Dhaka, is a graphics designer by day and student by night. His full-time schedule impedes him from spending quality time with friends or even family. Additionally, with the pandemic hovering over, his schedule somehow became shoddier than ever, and Sabbir was no longer living a normal life – a common complaint by loved ones.
He was not sleeping properly or feeling any attraction towards his favourite meals. Most of the time he was found lying on the couch, fatigued, tensed and irritable. His parents became concerned, not knowing what to do, they consulted with neighbours first, who referred a specialist to the family.
Today, Sabbir is back on his feet, thanks to the well-wishers, directing his family to the right course of action. Having completed his MBA successfully, he is pursuing better work opportunities elsewhere, one that matches his depth and competence. Sabbir has finally learned ways to spend quality time with loved ones, even amidst a hectic schedule, and has also taken up new hobbies, ones which he had been keen on adopting for long.
Was there any fairy-tale like enchantment involved…?
""Not at all,"" Jannat reminds us, ""Sabbir had been suffering from 'untreated borderline depression' for years, which got worse during the frenzied pandemic, but with consistent therapy he was thankfully able to get back on his feet, leading a healthy lifestyle once again.""
Jannat added on to say, ""Most of the time the answer is very easy. All a person has to do is meet with a psychologist or a psychiatrist and talk their way through mental health obstructions."" 
 








Shamima Akter, Psychological Counsellor, PHWC, further breaks down the process for us. ""Mental health has been a long unaddressed issue in this part of the continent, 'a topic', which we do not feel free to discuss at all because of the associated stigma.
""People consulting mental health practitioners are termed derogatively as 'pagol' and their medics as 'pagol er daktar.' It's so demeaning! We do not realise that physical and mental health actually go hand in hand, if one is not satisfactory, then the other is equally affected.""
According to both the psychologists, many patients who suffer from borderline mental dysfunctions could be easily treated with light therapies such as consultation, and one-to- one sessions with the practitioners. Instead, the patients 'prefer/choose' to hide their conditions in fear of the associated stigma, making the condition worse.
 








""Mental health is as important as physical health, if we go to the doctor for fever or a cough, then we should also go to a therapist when we feel anxious or agitated. A consultant can deduce the real reasons behind our problems and help in overcoming the unwanted condition,"" revealed Akter.
Finally, all being said, we assume that in the 21st century, people should be more empathetic towards people suffering from psychological distress, as they are to any other medical disorder, and should be 'informed and educated' enough to be able to direct the longsuffering, to a registered mental health clinic, if and when required.

All a person has to do is meet with a psychologist or a psychiatrist and talk their way through mental health obstructions."" Shamima Akter, Psychological Counsellor, PHWC, further breaks down the process for us. ""Mental health has been a long unaddressed issue in this part of the continent, 'a topic', which we do not feel free to discuss at all because of the associated stigma.""People consulting mental health practitioners are termed derogatively as 'pagol' and their medics as 'pagol er daktar.' It's so demeaning! We do not realise that physical and mental health actually go hand in hand, if one is not satisfactory, then the other is equally affected.""According to both the psychologists, many patients who suffer from borderline mental dysfunctions could be easily treated with light therapies such as consultation, and one-to- one sessions with the practitioners. Instead, the patients 'prefer/choose' to hide their conditions in fear of the associated stigma, making the condition worse.""Mental health is as important as physical health, if we go to the doctor for fever or a cough, then we should also go to a therapist when we feel anxious or agitated. A consultant can deduce the real reasons behind our problems and help in overcoming the unwanted condition,"" revealed Akter.Finally, all being said, we assume that in the 21st century, people should be more empathetic towards people suffering from psychological distress, as they are to any other medical disorder, and should be 'informed and educated' enough to be able to direct the longsuffering, to a registered mental health clinic, if and when required. Creatives: TurnUp Pr

386,"While we are all familiar with the common methods to nurture hair that include oiling, shampooing, conditioning, applying packs, and various hair treatments, what is scalp detox? Does one really need it?Scalp detox is essentially the method of deep cleansing the scalp to get rid of built-up debris and rebalance the pH of the skin. Over time, despite our regular cleansing routine, product, dirt, sweat, and oil can clog our hair follicles creating an unfavourable environment for the hair. Thus, a scalp detox is needed occasionally.""The skin of our head is simply an extension of the skin on our face. And just like we would exfoliate or scrub our face from time to time, our scalp requires the same care,"" explained Farzana Shakil, Beauty Expert and Image Consultant.Scalp detox is not very popular in our region but with time as advances are made and research unravels new techniques of personal care, detoxing the scalp seems to make its way to the list of necessities. Furthermore, the hot and humid climate of our country prompts problems such as itchiness, stickiness, and dandruff that calls for a refresh.""Detoxing the scalp promotes blood stimulation, which in turn improves the scalp health. Just like plants require fertile soil to grow, our hair also needs a healthy scalp for its nourishment. To attain this, just shampooing is often not enough,"" Farzana further explained.Our body has an amazing mechanism that signals us when something is off. Likewise, when you can feel noticeable build-up and debris along with itching and flaking on the scalp, it may be time for a detox. Hair feeling waxy or oily is another telling sign that a detox is needed.Hair detox can be done once a month or more or less often as required. This will depend on a variety of other lifestyle factors such as how often you wash your hair, how oily your scalp is, your exercise routine, and whether or not you cover your hair. Environmental factors should also be taken into consideration such as the level of pollution in your area and its climate.  However, be careful about overdoing it especially for those who have dry or damaged hair strands or if you have sensitive or broken skin on the scalp. The method used for detoxing the scalp is another aspect that will dictate its frequency.  There are several products and home remedies that can be applied for a proper and effective scalp detox. Apple cider vinegar, scrubbing products, aloe vera, and sugar are all viable options. However, one must be wary about using such products because everyone's skin is different. Thus, it is advisable to do a skin patch test first.""Some other options for detoxing the scalp include clarifying shampoo, friction massage, and soft scrub. Detoxification will keep the hair clean and healthy while eliminating dead skin cells and unclogging hair follicles,"" added Farzana Shakil.   Detoxing the scalp forms a favourable environment for hair to receive all the nourishment it requires, creating optimal conditions to thrive. If done correctly, adding this to your beauty regimen will let you dazzle all with those luscious locks. Photo:  Sazzad Ibne Sayed

387,"The nature trails of Bangladesh have a lot to offer, be it to flora and fauna enthusiasts or those looking for a spiritual experience. The roar of cascading waterfalls after monsoons, and the chirping of rare and exotic birds in unadulterated terrain, have a way of calling back those who have had a taste of trekking.For Saim Bin Mujib, a journalist and seasoned trekker, treks have always been a mode of self-discovery.
""Trekking always reminds me of what I am capable of. It tests my limits and demands my body to pull through, even when I think there is no option but to surrender. Whether it is the white-outs of foreign mountains, or hours of exhaustion and dehydration beyond what my body can bear locally, the hurdles help me get in tune with myself,"" explained Saim.Although testing your limits may be a life-changing experience, in your first few treks, it is best to be cautious and prepared. Here are some things to keep in mind, according to Saim, during the first few times you venture out.Places to pin
Hills, slopes, and mountains can be a bit more challenging but the rewarding views near waterfalls and peaks usually make it worth it. If you want to experience the distinct serenity waterfalls induce with their majestic appearance and white noise, you should keep Hum Hum waterfall, Khoiyachora waterfall and Nafa-khum waterfall on your list. Although waterfalls are the liveliest during the peak of monsoon, it may be risky for newbies to trek then, as the soil may be extra slippery.
""September and October may be the best time to visit as the waterfalls still retain their beauty near the end of monsoon, without the trails being too difficult to navigate,"" advised Saim.

If you would rather trek through plains and flat lands, Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Lawachara National Park and St Martin's 360° are good options. Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary and Lawachara National Park are the perfect fix for those who are curious about the evergreen and deciduous forest biomes of Bangladesh. Both nature reserves house a wealth of plant, bird, primate, and reptile species, many of which are rare and endangered.
Dressing the part
Although there is usually no worry regarding weather extremities in Bangladesh, it is best to stay prepared. During winter, full length pants and windbreaker jackets are ideal as the weather tends to get pretty cold in the high altitudes during the morning and evening. Windbreakers are light but protective so they are the best for trekking.
""The sunlight can still get scorching by noon, so you may find yourself taking off your windbreaker anyways,"" remarked Saim.
For summer, a breathable t-shirt, and some half or three-quarter pants can usually get the job done. Although sneakers are good for winter, they may feel too suffocating during summer months. Sandals with a good grip and a supportive back strap are the better option during warmer months. If there is a chance of rain, carry a raincoat.
Your backpack should be one that is specialised for travel. The extra straps help evenly distribute the weight of the bag, while also supporting your balance.

Packing the necessities
It is often hard to strike a balance between packing everything you need and ensuring your backpack stays light. Regardless, there are some items you must always have within easy reach.
Make sure you have an emergency kit with all the medicine and supplies you may need.
""The first aid box for trekking has some of the more regular items, such as pain killers, band aid, and antacid. Then there are the extras, which you need to make sure you are healthy and hydrated throughout your hike. This includes electrolyte solutions and glucose. Dehydration is a common ailment during hikes,'' warned Saim.
If you plan to stay the night, make sure to carry a headlamp or torch as you may need to leave your tent or accommodation when it is pitch black outside. For winters, carry a sleeping bag and extra layers of clothing in case it gets too cold.
Guides help
When visiting Bandarban, make sure you take a guide. Not only will they help make sure you are on track wherever you go, some can help make your overall experience much easier by helping with things like cooking.
Trekking poles will be your second guide, so make sure to take one as well. Trekking poles make crossing slippery soil a lot easier and will also help you navigate shallow water bodies and streams.
The biggest don't
""One of the biggest don'ts when it comes to trekking is to disturb the natural environment or the people you encounter. Many trekkers have the tendency to litter whatever they have in their hands, be it plastic bags or tissue paper. Others tend to be insensitive to locals they come across simply because of their cultural practices. It is crucial to leave wherever you go virtually untouched in all ways possible,"" recommended Saim.

391,"Have you ever come across a man who claimed himself to be more knowledgeable than you, even though you are more experienced in that particular field? If yes, you have been mansplained.Mansplaining is a gruesome act that has been taking place for centuries now due to some men and their egos being grander than the seven wonders of the world. Yes, the wonders may change but they will not.Knowingly or unknowingly, we are often a victim of this prejudice in organisations, institutions, and even public places. Hence, to elevate your idea about mansplaining and to give you the shield of self-preservation against it, here is the context in a nutshell:How is mansplaining done?
There is an array of ways a man can mansplain a woman, but the most common one is when they believe they are superior to them just based on their gender. How peculiar and obnoxious you may think? Sadly, this is the truth. As if equality does not have a place in their dictionary. Well, neither does consent, but let's not go there. You may hear the hymn of 'not all men are the same' playing in the background!
On a serious note, a classic example of mansplaining is when you are working with a male and you probably need help with it. For some odd and very unknown reasons, the man has an indefinite urge pouring through his veins to help you. Even when you clearly and vocally said that you do not need it, he insisted as if that was vested to him by the supreme power of the universe.
How to escape mansplaining?
As much as you may wish to have a golden guide to escape mansplaining, it does not exist. However, what does exist is the ability to say no. There are instances where we may think raising our voices or declining may result in a worse situation. Imagine figures like Marie Curie or Malala Yousafzai having a similar mind-set. Would our race have advanced to what it has to now? The answer is, never.
Therefore, as much as it may hurt the person in front of you, you need to take your stand. You have to mark your territory even if it subjects you to ostracisation. Yes, that is an over-exaggeration of what may happen but the reply should always be louder than the mistreatment. This is why always prepare for the worst and do your best. Years of suffrage for gaining the right to raise your voices should not be wasted.
The bottom line
To conclude, one must never mansplain. It is unacceptable and unjust. No one should feel belittled or less valued due to his or her gender. So, the next time you see someone mansplaining you, do not forget to point out their absence in the extreme sport called 'mutual respect!'

392,"Every now and then, you come across a place where you would like to pitch your tent and stay forever. For me, that's Indaba Studio in Marylebone, London. I have been teaching yoga for more than 20 years, and learning for longer, so you can guess how many studios I have been to over the years, and yet this one rises above the rest to win a place in my heart. Are you wondering why? Here are the top 4 things I love about Indaba Studio.Experienced teachersThe studio has a collection of extremely dedicated teachers who are deep into their yoga practice and have a lot of wisdom to share. These yogis are not only teaching (at very advanced levels), they also walk the talk, so there is much more to learn from them, apart from challenging postures. I have had the privilege of practicing with a few of the teachers at Indaba, including Leon London, Emi Tull, Stewart Gilchrist, and Ambra Vallo. They are gentle and demanding, focused and open-hearted, and they know just how to inspire every student to be his or her best self.Mixing it upI'm a student of Ashtanga, and in search of great Ashtanga teachers, I often end up in studios that offer only Ashtanga. But I like to explore new methods also to see how they complement my madness. At Indaba, there are incredible teachers and the option to explore Primal, Rocket, Dharma, Yogasana and Vinyasa flow. There are also Pilates classes and yin yoga classes, to round it all off.Atmosphere and energyI love the feeling I get when I walk in because of the atmosphere created. There are incense sticks burning and soft chanting music in the background, as well as a small shop of yogi treasures, such as chakra healing crystals and copper tongue scrapers, as well as mats and yoga pants, of course. Most important is the community that thrives around this studio — yoga lovers from all over the world who are going deeper into the practice and the lifestyle, other yoga teachers, people who perform in Cirque du Soleil and other acrobatic adventurers, as well as ordinary people who want a dose of positivity in their day.Online optionThe studio now streams all its classes online. This is a special treat for us in Bangladesh. We can now access classes by Indaba's amazing teachers right from our own living room!Indaba On Demand is another option which allows you to watch recorded sessions with any of the teachers at any time you like. Online and On-Demand gives us the flexibility to practice anytime, anywhere!Indaba Studio creates a space for yogis to connect, support each other and grow. This is ideal to progress in yoga and even to go deeper into self-study. Group energy helps elevate positive frequencies and cultivate a contagious passion to go deeper.

393,"'The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance' — wrote Aristotle to emphasise the significance of art. Abstract values like freedom are different to express but art can give them an image that touches our heart. Recently, there was an art exhibition at the Bangabandhu Military Museum titled ""Bangabandhu, Liberation War and Bangladesh"" that explored our glorious history.The Museum
Honourable Prime Minister inaugurated the museum on 6 January, 2022. After a construction period of six years, the world class edifice was opened for public. The project was carried out by the E in C branch of Bangladesh Army. The Engineer in Chief was responsible for the project. Brig Gen Md Mahbubul Islam was the project director. Architect Ali Imam and Architect Bayezid Khandaker were the lead architects, and Nazneen Haque Mimi played the role of ID consultant. Spectra Engineers Ltd. served as the developing partner. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
As you step in through the main entrance, you will notice a mesmerising yard of soothing green. A cleverly designed sculpture of Bangabandhu stands out along with other sculptures of soldiers. The water bodies on the sides blend into a picturesque look. Upon entering the main building, you will also notice the wide lobby with the Toshakhana Museum on your right. Walking through the Victory Arena (Bijoy Angina), you can get to the exhibition gallery. 
The Art Exhibition
Some of the most celebrated artists in the country took part in this exhibition. The extraordinarily aesthetic 'Rakhal Guerrilla' of artist Rafiqun Nabi was being displayed on the ground floor. The bright and eye-catching piece reminds you that in an artist's hands, everything comes alive. The left wall on the ground floor looked very graceful as it donned two paintings of artist Hashem Khan about 7th March and the 6-points. As you stand in front of these spectacular paintings, you feel your heart overtaken by passion that can only be inspired by the historic speech of 7th March.
Another wall displayed eight artworks by artist Shahabuddin Ahmed; all of them about Bangabandhu and the Liberation War. A number of glass showcases as well as open showcases were displaying different sculptures. About 38 sculptures created by 10 different sculptors were presented in the exhibition. Tributes were paid to Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin and Potua Quamrul Hassan.
Nazneen Haque Mimi is also curating the gallery. Paintings done by many renowned artists were displayed here. Artist Mohammad Eunus, Rokeya Sultana, Nisar Hossain, Shahid Kabir, Muniruzzaman, Abdul Mannan, Mohammad Iqbal and many young and bright artists' artworks were presented. Some 90 artists and 10 sculptors participated in this exhibition. There was a portrait of Bangabandhu done by artist Ahmed Shamsuddoha that is exceptionally accurate. The painting reminds you what an imposing character Bangabandhu really was and it's a special one since the French Government used this portrait to make a stamp about Bangabandhu. 'Colours of Bangladesh' and 'Gallery Chitrak' cooperated with the exhibition.
 








The Gallery
Standing on a round water body, crystal clear glass encases the gallery. One can see through the glass, which gives the illusion of floating on water. There are two more floors underneath expanding both under the water body and underground. Nazneen Haque Mimi and Spectra took care of the interior decorations. The whole gallery has a marble clad floor and clear glass separates the ground floor part from the rest of the museum. Metal false ceiling covers the gallery along with durable and insect-proof materials to ensure that the gallery remains in pristine condition. The walls buttress a secondary wall that has been dehumidified and is acoustic in nature. As a result, there are no echoes. With perforation and 3d, it offers a complete protection for the paintings.
One can go to the basement using the stairs or the lift. The double high space and an eye-catching circular celling reminds you of how large the gallery really is. The paintings were displayed in such manner that each maintained their individuality.
Through a ramp and a small staircase, one can access basement two. At the centre point, there are two large columns that support the gallery upstairs. The whole place is highlighted with track lights and the lighting system is automated. The paintings are hung on metal panels so this multipurpose gallery can host any sort of exhibitions.
Small sofas and benches are arranged by the curator as sitting arrangements all over the gallery so one can relax, take their time and enjoy the exhibition. Digital gadgets such as signage, vertical signage, dual monitor kiosk is available all across the gallery and they offer information to the visitors.

Artist Mohammad Eunus, Rokeya Sultana, Nisar Hossain, Shahid Kabir, Muniruzzaman, Abdul Mannan, Mohammad Iqbal and many young and bright artists' artworks were presented. Some 90 artists and 10 sculptors participated in this exhibition. There was a portrait of Bangabandhu done by artist Ahmed Shamsuddoha that is exceptionally accurate. The painting reminds you what an imposing character Bangabandhu really was and it's a special one since the French Government used this portrait to make a stamp about Bangabandhu. 'Colours of Bangladesh' and 'Gallery Chitrak' cooperated with the exhibition.The Gallery
Standing on a round water body, crystal clear glass encases the gallery. One can see through the glass, which gives the illusion of floating on water. There are two more floors underneath expanding both under the water body and underground. Nazneen Haque Mimi and Spectra took care of the interior decorations. The whole gallery has a marble clad floor and clear glass separates the ground floor part from the rest of the museum. Metal false ceiling covers the gallery along with durable and insect-proof materials to ensure that the gallery remains in pristine condition. The walls buttress a secondary wall that has been dehumidified and is acoustic in nature. As a result, there are no echoes. With perforation and 3d, it offers a complete protection for the paintings.
One can go to the basement using the stairs or the lift. The double high space and an eye-catching circular celling reminds you of how large the gallery really is. The paintings were displayed in such manner that each maintained their individuality.
Through a ramp and a small staircase, one can access basement two. At the centre point, there are two large columns that support the gallery upstairs. The whole place is highlighted with track lights and the lighting system is automated. The paintings are hung on metal panels so this multipurpose gallery can host any sort of exhibitions.
Small sofas and benches are arranged by the curator as sitting arrangements all over the gallery so one can relax, take their time and enjoy the exhibition. Digital gadgets such as signage, vertical signage, dual monitor kiosk is available all across the gallery and they offer information to the visitors.

394,"""We will take immediate steps"" or ""We will discuss the matter"" are the common words of reassurance coming from the authorities. However, these words have made little to no effect when it comes to resolving the issues for real.""We will take immediate steps"" or ""We will discuss the matter"" are the common words of reassurance coming from the authorities. However, these words have made little to no effect when it comes to resolving the issues for real.Over the last few years, Jahangirnagar University (JU) authorities have made many promises to its students regarding several unresolved issues. However, not much progress has been made on those fronts.""We will take immediate steps"" or ""we will discuss the matter"" are common words of reassurance coming from the authorities. However, these words have made little to no effect when it comes to resolving the issues for real.On June 28, 2019, JU Vice-Chancellor Prof Farzana Islam declared to hold Jahangirnagar University Central Students' Union (Jucsu) polls by November that year, followed by a senate meeting.A chief election commissioner was also appointed on July 31, 2019 for that purpose. But Jucsu polls are far from reality, even after two and a half years.Recently, there were discussions regarding internet facilities, food quality and health insurance for students. On January 3, Rahima Kaneez, JU's acting registrar, told the media, ""We will discuss health insurance for students with the authorities.""This newspaper, on January 18 published a detailed report on the university's waste management system, which has been non-functional since 2020. When this correspondent contacted the university's acting registrar regarding the issue, she again said, ""I have come to know of the situation just now. We will discuss the matter.""""No measures regarding the issues are in effect, maybe because these 'discussions' never take place,"" said Ashfar Rahman Nabin, an international relations major, expressing his dissatisfaction over the authority's inaction.""Do they make these commitments to resolve the issues or escape them?"" Nabin posed the question.Similar commitments were made about improving medical and library facilities, holding convocations and solving accommodation crises, but to no effect.Students, too, have started to adjust to the present situation, having lost faith in the administration's intervention.""Representatives of the authorities utter the same statement when asked about any issue, without actually working to resolve them. Problems, by then, become established realities,"" said Md Elanur Islam, a law student.""JU is no different from our country in its arbitrariness. Students don't trust the authorities anymore for their fake promises made over the years,"" said Rakibul Rony, president of Bangladesh Student Union's JU chapter.Prof Anu Mohammad, JU faculty member and eminent economist, echoed the same sentiments. ""It has become a culture to manage the crisis through commitments. There is absolutely no accountability on the authorities' part.""""The government should show interest to uplift the universities from this crisis and create a culture of accountability,"" he added.Asked, JU acting registrar Rahima Kaneez was unable to present any progress on their commitments.""It's not like we don't discuss the issues, but actions require time. This is not a strategy, and our commitments are not fake,"" Kaneez said.""We try our best to fulfil our commitments. However, there are complexities that hinder us from presenting the progress,"" said JU pro-VC (academic) Prof Md Nurul Alam. Despite attempts, this correspondent could not get in touch with the VC.",youth

However, she did not pluck up the courage to join them because such activities were strictly prohibited in her household.She eventually broke all barriers and started practicing when she was in the ninth grade. Marzan won a gold medal in the singles event at the 2019 South Asian Games. She also secured two bronze medals in the 28th National Karate Championship in Bangladesh and two silver medals in the 9th Bangabandhu Bangladesh Games. She has participated in competitions in Dubai, India, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Malaysia.Despite all her success, she is no stranger to failures and obstacles. ""In the pursuit of karate, I have faced many challenges, most of which stemmed from people passing negative comments behind my back. I never felt comfortable going out in my uniform because people in our country are conservative. It is beyond their belief that a girl from a reputed school like Viqarunnisa would want to  'throw her life away' by engaging in martial arts,"" shared Marzan.Now, she is a Fine Arts student at Jagannath University. Even though balancing her studies and karate practices is taxing on her both mentally and physically, she still perseveres with all her might. ""Fortunately, my teachers are very supportive. If I miss any class or test because of a game, they let me take it on a later date,"" she said.Her next goal is to participate in the Asian Karate Championship and World Karate Federation. ""Even if I don't win at those competitions, I think I will learn many important lessons from international coaches and players. I am just a simple girl from a small town, who managed to come this far,"" she added. ""If our girls are given proper guidance, imagine what else they can do. I believe Bangladesh can also earn a world ranking in karate.""Regardless of the hurdles that come her way, Marzan carries on with her willpower and determination. The author is a student of BRAC University, and a freelance journalist.

Soon after her marriage, she was ousted from her in-laws' house, as she was made to choose between them or her education. Persistent and full of grit, she chose the latter.At that time, both a kilo of flour and a notebook cost Tk 10. If we bought flour, my education would have been hindered, so my mother chose to buy notebooks over our bread.Sheuli Akter
Her hardship eventually bore fruit as Sheuli, overcoming all barriers of poverty, child-marriage and abuse, became a doctor by achieving an MBBS from Barind Medical College in Rajshahi in January.
Talking to this correspondent, Sheuli said she developed her enthusiasm for education during her time at Sardaha Government Primary School. ""I was fond of watching boys and girls studying at school and the way they spoke. I wanted to be just like them.""
Sheuli learned that only the brightest students studied at the school and insisted her mother enrolled her there. Her mother soon took her to a private tutor.
""I noticed the private tutor offered my mother a broken chair to sit on and treated her differently than others. I don't know how she made him agree to teach me,"" Sheuli said.
Sheuli's father, Zahangir Hossain, could barely afford his family of seven earning a meagre sum from a tea stall.
""At that time, both a kilo of flour and a notebook cost Tk 10. If we bought flour, my education would have been hindered, so my mother chose to buy notebooks over our bread.""
She caught the attention of her teachers when she obtained stipend in fifth and eighth grades.
Yet her father married her off to Rashidul Islam, a bulb seller, in 2009 when she was appearing for the ninth-grade second term examination. ""I cried a lot. But later realised that my husband was kind towards me,"" she said.
She thought the food crisis would be over at her in-laws' house. But they opposed her education from the start, and wagered her access to food if she continued.
""They gave us a choice, either I stop my education or we leave their house. My husband took me out of his parents' house to support me,"" she told this correspondent, sitting at their rented house in the city's Meherchandi, where they live with their only son.
After she passed HSC in 2013, Md Shamsuddin, managing director of Barind Medical College, offered her free education at the college and her husband a job at the hospital.
Contacted, Md Shamsuddin, father of state minister for foreign affairs Mohammad Shahriar Alam, said his son had financed her education, with Sheuli being one of 30 beneficiaries.

""We usually have to return by 12 noon at treks and must finish by 2 pm as the weather almost always worsens at that period. I almost reached the summit of Yala at 1 pm but due to the weather, my team had to return,"" the mountaineer recalls.""I was injured during that trek and after returning I felt it needed proper training to continue my passion for mountain trekking,"" says Joynab. ""So, I joined the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering for a month-long course covering the basic mechanisms and mathematics of mountaineering.""Due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns all over the world, Joynab could not trek in 2020 after her last trek in Ladakh. She went to Mount Pharchamu in Nepal at the end of 2021 but the trek was unsuccessful due to heavy snowfall.She had to abandon the trek halfway after almost reaching the summit of the mountain.""Saddened by the failure, I set my sight on a new mountain—Mount Lobuche.

414,"Two doctors have swam across the Bangla Channel, the 16.1km stretch of the Bay of Bengal between the Teknaf Fisheries Jetty and the jetty in Saint Martin's Island, claiming to be the first ever doctors to do so in the country.They are Dr Saklayen Russel, associate professor and head of the Department of Vascular Surgery at Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital and Research Institute Associate and Dr Zanzibul Tareq, cardiovascular surgeon at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).They started swimming from Paschimpara beach on Shahpari Island in Teknaf, the southernmost border of the country, at 11:15am on Monday (December 20).Marking the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence, 79 swimmers attempted to cross the Bangla Channel this time. However, as the sea was rough, 25 swimmers quit half way through the course.Dr Saklayen Russel told The Daily Star, ""We are the first doctors in the country to have crossed the Bangla Channel. It took six hours and 41 minutes for me achieve the feat and Dr Tareq did it in six hours and 50 minutes.""Asked why he decided to swim across the channel, he said that due to his eye ailment his doctor advised him to take a pause in his daily workout.""I asked my doctor if I could swim instead of running and jogging, the doctor said I can. Then I started swimming. But you know if you do not have a target and motivation, workout becomes monotonous. Then I decided that I would cross the Bangla Channel,"" he said.""Since we are doctors, we wanted to make people aware through swimming. Secondly, St Martin has been declared ecologically endangered. But to protect a place like this, the government and the people have to work together. The government must act on maintaining ecological balance,"" said Dr Saklayen.Asked how he prepared himself for swimming, Dr Saklayen said, ""I had been preparing for it for the last six months. I took preparation under Saiful Islam Russell, who has crossed the Bangla channel twice before.""Bangladesh Edible Oil Limited Brand Fortune, was the main sponsor of 16th Bangla Channel Swimming Competition. Bangladesh Coast Guard was the rescue partner. Partners include Bangladesh Tourism Corporation, Bangladesh Tourism Board, United Securities, South Bangla Agriculture and Commerce Bank Limited, Sharaj Adventure, VISAThing and Studio Dhaka.Notably, late Kazi Hamidul Haque, famous for his adventures, discovered this channel in the Bay of Bengal. Lipton Sarkar, Fazlul Kabir and Salman Saeed crossed the channel for the first time in 2006.",youth
